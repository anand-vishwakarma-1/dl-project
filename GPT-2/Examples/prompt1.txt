Sansa Stark : We've always known the king would oppose any attempt to undermine our military alliance.

Brienne : He wouldn't be a Targaryen without a Targaryen.

Sansa Stark : You would be in a position to convince him.

Brienne : So, his campaign against the Starks would probably win him no more than an entire city.

Sansa Stark : Perhaps.

Brienne : Of course.

Brienne : What is it about Ramsay?

Sansa Stark : He didn't want us to do anything to stop him.

Brienne : We did anything to stop him?

Sansa Stark : He wanted me dead.

Brienne : Why should I care what he wants? I'm Tigard Stark. I can help you.

Sansa Stark : I can. Please, don't do it.

Brienne : Stop it.

Sansa Stark : Our alliances are best defended by our friends.

Brienne : I can't.

Sansa Stark : Tell me what you want.

Brienne : It's not an alliance. It's an effort to defeat Ser Loras Tyrell. A war.

Sansa Stark : Do you know who ordered that attack?

Brienne : I did not.
