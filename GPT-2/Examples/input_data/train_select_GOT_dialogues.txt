Jon Snow : Go on. Father's watching.

Jon Snow : And your mother.

Eddard Stark : And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.

Jon Snow : Don't think too much, Bran.

Eddard Stark : Get the lads to saddle their horses.

Eddard Stark : He swore an oath, Cat.

Eddard Stark : Tell Bran he's coming, too.

Eddard Stark : He won't be a boy forever. And winter is coming.

Eddard Stark : nods yes, and WILL is positioned on the tree limb that serves as a block.

Eddard Stark : In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name .

Jon Snow : Don't look away.

Eddard Stark : King of the Andals and the First Men .

Jon Snow : Father will know if you do.

Eddard Stark : Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.

Jon Snow : You did well.

Eddard Stark : You understand why I did it?

Eddard Stark : But do you understand why I had to kill him?

Eddard Stark : The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.

Eddard Stark : The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.

Eddard Stark : A madman sees what he sees.

Jon Snow : What is it?

Eddard Stark : There are no mountain lions in these woods.

Eddard Stark : It's a direwolf.

Eddard Stark : Tough old beast.

Jon Snow : Now there are five.

Jon Snow : You want to hold it?

Eddard Stark : Better a quick death. They won't last without their mother.

Eddard Stark : I'm sorry, Bran.

Jon Snow : Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.

Eddard Stark : You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.

Jon Snow : I'm not a Stark. Get on.

Eddard Stark : You have five northern children. You're not an outsider.

Eddard Stark : It's your gods with all the rules.

Eddard Stark : Tell me.

Eddard Stark : Your sister. The boy .

Eddard Stark : He's coming this far North, there's only one thing he's after.

Jon Snow : Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?

Eddard Stark : Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA's helm]

Eddard Stark : Your Grace.

Eddard Stark : Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.

Eddard Stark : My queen.

Eddard Stark : Tell me about Jon Arryn.

Eddard Stark : We both did.

Eddard Stark : Aye.

Eddard Stark : I'm not worthy of the honor.

Tyrion Lannister : Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.

Tyrion Lannister : I did hear something about that.

Tyrion Lannister : And the other brother?

Tyrion Lannister : There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.

Tyrion Lannister : I hear he hates that nickname.

Tyrion Lannister : Clever girl.

Tyrion Lannister : Have you?

Tyrion Lannister : The gods gave me one blessing.

Tyrion Lannister : Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?

Tyrion Lannister : She has odd cravings, our sister.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.

Tyrion Lannister : Close the door!

Eddard Stark : She was my sister. This is where she belongs.

Eddard Stark : It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.

Jon Snow : Uncle Benjen!

Jon Snow : Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.

Jon Snow : So take me with you when you go back.

Jon Snow : Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will.

Jon Snow : I'm ready to swear your oath.

Jon Snow : I don't care about that.

Tyrion Lannister : Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.

Jon Snow : What're you doing back there?

Tyrion Lannister : Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.

Jon Snow : You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?

Tyrion Lannister : My greatest accomplishment. You - you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?

Tyrion Lannister : Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.

Jon Snow : Lord Eddard Stark is my father.

Tyrion Lannister : And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.

Jon Snow : What the hell do you know about being a bastard?

Tyrion Lannister : All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.

Eddard Stark : The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?

Eddard Stark : He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.

Eddard Stark : A wildling ambush.

Eddard Stark : Winter is coming.

Eddard Stark : Your pardon.

Eddard Stark : Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.

Eddard Stark : I don't fight in tournaments.

Eddard Stark : I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do.

Eddard Stark : I'm a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat's nest they call a capital.

Eddard Stark : The king takes what he wants. That's why he's king.

Eddard Stark : How did he get so fat?

Eddard Stark : Send him in.

Eddard Stark : Stay.

Eddard Stark : What news?

Eddard Stark : She's fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn't know what she's saying.

Tyrion Lannister : If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle.

Tyrion Lannister : The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.

Eddard Stark : No, but I'm still better than you.

Eddard Stark : I hope I'll serve you well.

Tyrion Lannister : Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.

Tyrion Lannister : None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.

Tyrion Lannister : One word and I'll hit you again.

Tyrion Lannister : Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?

Tyrion Lannister : Do you understand?

Tyrion Lannister : I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast...

Tyrion Lannister : Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black.

Tyrion Lannister : Beloved siblings.

Tyrion Lannister : Apparently not.

Tyrion Lannister : The Maester says the boy may live.

Tyrion Lannister : Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.

Tyrion Lannister : Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.

Tyrion Lannister : And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.

Tyrion Lannister : Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.

Tyrion Lannister : My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family.

Jon Snow : I already have one.

Jon Snow : Of course I have.

Jon Snow : We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.

Jon Snow : Soon enough.

Jon Snow : It's good you've got help.

Jon Snow : Impressive.

Jon Snow : I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.

Jon Snow : Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.

Jon Snow : So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.

Jon Snow : You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?

Jon Snow : First lesson

Jon Snow : I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know.

Jon Snow : I came to say goodbye to Bran.

Jon Snow : I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid.

Eddard Stark : I have no choice.

Eddard Stark : You can. You must.

Jon Snow : You Starks are hard to kill.

Jon Snow : She was very kind.

Jon Snow : It was always my color.

Jon Snow : And you, Stark.

Eddard Stark : There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood.

Jon Snow : Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?

Eddard Stark : The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise.

Eddard Stark : I've half a mind to go with you.

Eddard Stark : You should have asked me 20 years ago.

Eddard Stark : I recall a few chances.

Eddard Stark : Bessie. She was one of yours.

Eddard Stark : Wylla.

Eddard Stark : Nor will I.

Eddard Stark : The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.

Eddard Stark : Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?

Eddard Stark : She's little more than a child.

Eddard Stark : Tell me we're not speaking of this.

Eddard Stark : But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?

Eddard Stark : Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert.

Eddard Stark : He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.

Tyrion Lannister : Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.

Jon Snow : Why do you read so much?

Tyrion Lannister : Look at me and tell me what you see.

Jon Snow : Is this a trick?

Tyrion Lannister : What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.

Jon Snow : Until your brother killed that King.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?

Jon Snow : Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.

Tyrion Lannister : A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.

Jon Snow : The Night's Watch protects the realm from...

Tyrion Lannister : Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly.

Eddard Stark : Where is she?

Eddard Stark : Who took her?

Eddard Stark : Right, get back.

Eddard Stark : Back! Back to the inn. All back!

Eddard Stark : Are you hurt?

Eddard Stark : It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?

Eddard Stark : In bed asleep.

Eddard Stark : Stop it! That's enough of that.

Eddard Stark : Stop! Arya!

Eddard Stark : Gladly, your Grace.

Eddard Stark : You can't mean it.

Eddard Stark : s this your command... your Grace?

Eddard Stark : No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself.

Eddard Stark : The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.

Eddard Stark : The butcher's boy... You rode him down?

Eddard Stark : Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them.

Eddard Stark : Glad to see you're protecting the throne.

Eddard Stark : Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.

Eddard Stark : You've chosen your opponents wisely then.

Eddard Stark : But you just stood there and watched.

Eddard Stark : Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?

Eddard Stark : You served him well, when serving was safe.

Eddard Stark : Lord Varys.

Eddard Stark : A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.

Eddard Stark : She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.

Eddard Stark : Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.

Eddard Stark : Grand Maester.

Eddard Stark : And you served another King.

Eddard Stark : Without the King?

Eddard Stark : 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.

Eddard Stark : Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?

Eddard Stark : How could you let this happen?

Eddard Stark : I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.

Eddard Stark : I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.

Eddard Stark : There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.

Eddard Stark : What's happening here?

Eddard Stark : Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love.

Eddard Stark : The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?

Eddard Stark : It's all right. Go on.

Eddard Stark : War was easier than daughters.

Eddard Stark : Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?

Eddard Stark : Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.

Eddard Stark : Come here. Now what do you want with this?

Eddard Stark : A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?

Eddard Stark : laughs] That's the essence of it.

Eddard Stark : No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy.

Eddard Stark : Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.

Eddard Stark : Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.

Eddard Stark : Well. Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.

Eddard Stark : You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.

Eddard Stark : I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours.

Eddard Stark : Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.

Tyrion Lannister : A charming man.

Tyrion Lannister : And how's that going, Commander Mormont?

Tyrion Lannister : Good news or bad?

Eddard Stark : My wife is in Winterfell.

Eddard Stark : You're a funny man. A very funny man.

Jon Snow : It's an improvement.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.

Tyrion Lannister : It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.

Jon Snow : Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.

Tyrion Lannister : Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice

Jon Snow : They hate me because I'm better than they are.

Tyrion Lannister : It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.

Eddard Stark : It's too dangerous.

Eddard Stark : Until we know who our enemies are...

Eddard Stark : Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.

Eddard Stark : Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.

Eddard Stark : He still loves you.

Eddard Stark : Off with you.

Jon Snow : You're leaving?

Jon Snow : What kind of reports?

Jon Snow : m ready. I won't let you down.

Jon Snow : But I'm better than every...

Tyrion Lannister : You're joking?

Tyrion Lannister : And how do a bear's balls taste?

Tyrion Lannister : Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?

Tyrion Lannister : They have a better chance finding feed than glory.

Tyrion Lannister : You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.

Tyrion Lannister : But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.

Tyrion Lannister : I think he's starting to like me. "Going below"?

Tyrion Lannister : So you're heading down to King's Landing too.

Tyrion Lannister : Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.

Tyrion Lannister : Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.

Jon Snow : Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.

Tyrion Lannister : Eight... no, nine.

Tyrion Lannister : They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.

Jon Snow : I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister : It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.

Jon Snow : Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?

Tyrion Lannister : I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.

Jon Snow : If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course.

Jon Snow : He'll never walk again.

Tyrion Lannister : If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.

Jon Snow : Farewell, My Lord.

Tyrion Lannister : I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.

Tyrion Lannister : Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?

Tyrion Lannister : Then you might learn a lordo s courtesy.

Tyrion Lannister : So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?

Tyrion Lannister : Curious.

Tyrion Lannister : Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you like to ride, Bran?

Tyrion Lannister : What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.

Tyrion Lannister : Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.

Tyrion Lannister : You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.

Tyrion Lannister : I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.

Tyrion Lannister : Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.

Tyrion Lannister : Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.

Tyrion Lannister : No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?

Tyrion Lannister : She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?

Tyrion Lannister : My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?

Tyrion Lannister : Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out.

Tyrion Lannister : A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire.

Tyrion Lannister : I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out.

Jon Snow : Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it.

Jon Snow : Enough! He yielded.

Jon Snow : Are you sure you want to do this?

Jon Snow : I've had worse.

Jon Snow : It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself.

Jon Snow : The Wall's no place for cowards.

Eddard Stark : The King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.

Eddard Stark : You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.

Eddard Stark : You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left.

Eddard Stark : The sooner this is over, the better.

Eddard Stark : I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?

Eddard Stark : I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.

Eddard Stark : Why?

Eddard Stark : What did Jon want the night before he died?

Eddard Stark : A book? What book?

Eddard Stark : I'd like to read it.

Eddard Stark : Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained

Eddard Stark : Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?

Eddard Stark : Jon's death...

Eddard Stark : Did he say anything to you during his final hours?

Eddard Stark : The seed is strong"? What does that mean?

Eddard Stark : And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?

Eddard Stark : Poison.

Eddard Stark : I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.

Eddard Stark : Everybody knows that.

Eddard Stark : I've taken enough of your time.

Eddard Stark : Thank you. I'll find my own way out.

Eddard Stark : It's a hard fall down these steps.

Eddard Stark : Cats? Syrio says.

Eddard Stark : He's right about that.

Eddard Stark : He needs to get his strength back first.

Eddard Stark : No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.

Eddard Stark : You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.

Jon Snow : Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.

Jon Snow : You're not. You're freezing.

Jon Snow : You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?

Jon Snow : Yes, he is.

Jon Snow : Well. You can't get any worse.

Eddard Stark : Pycelle talks too much.

Eddard Stark : Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?

Eddard Stark : Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.

Eddard Stark : Varys or the Queen?

Eddard Stark : Yes.

Eddard Stark : Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.

Eddard Stark : A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.

Eddard Stark : Let them look.

Eddard Stark : What did Lord Arryn want?

Eddard Stark : I'd like to see him as well.

Eddard Stark : This is fine work.

Eddard Stark : There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?

Eddard Stark : What kind of questions?

Eddard Stark : Your mother?

Eddard Stark : What did you tell him?

Eddard Stark : Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me.

Eddard Stark : King Robert's bastard son.

Jon Snow : Watch duty. With Sam.

Jon Snow : He wasn't hungry.

Jon Snow : That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.

Jon Snow : No one touches Sam.

Jon Snow : I wouldn't doubt it.

Jon Snow : Sally on the side?

Jon Snow : I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.

Jon Snow : As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.

Jon Snow : I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but...

Jon Snow : I know where to put it.

Jon Snow : Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.

Jon Snow : Red.

Jon Snow : You don't want to know.

Jon Snow : Better.

Jon Snow : What's my name?

Jon Snow : And why is my surname Snow?

Jon Snow : I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child.

Jon Snow : I build my own fires.

Eddard Stark : Your Grace.

Eddard Stark : Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.

Eddard Stark : She likes it here.

Eddard Stark : What are you doing here?

Eddard Stark : The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.

Eddard Stark : If that's my job, then so be it.

Eddard Stark : I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace.

Tyrion Lannister : My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room.

Tyrion Lannister : Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?

Tyrion Lannister : There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.

Tyrion Lannister : Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.

Tyrion Lannister : I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this.

Eddard Stark : Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?

Eddard Stark : He'd never worn this armor before.

Eddard Stark : Who determines the draw?

Eddard Stark : Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters.

Eddard Stark : I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her.

Eddard Stark : My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.

Eddard Stark : And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?

Eddard Stark : Yes. That will never happen.

Eddard Stark : If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.

Eddard Stark : You're too fat for your armor.

Eddard Stark : You're torturing the poor boy.

Eddard Stark : The breastplate stretcher?

Eddard Stark : Maybe you should have one invented.

Eddard Stark : You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.

Eddard Stark : And who's going to hit you back?

Eddard Stark : There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.

Eddard Stark : Aye.

Eddard Stark : I'm not thirsty.

Eddard Stark : Your squire... A Lannister boy?

Eddard Stark : Robert?

Eddard Stark : Where's Arya

Eddard Stark : Hey.

Eddard Stark : Ser Loras rides well.

Tyrion Lannister : This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.

Tyrion Lannister : Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Wordo s probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?

Tyrion Lannister : Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?

Tyrion Lannister : She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here.

Tyrion Lannister : Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!

Tyrion Lannister : What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?

Tyrion Lannister : Why? Am I starting to make sense?

Tyrion Lannister : Untie me. If I die, what's the point?

Tyrion Lannister : Well, I'm willing if she is.

Eddard Stark : He'll never walk again.

Eddard Stark : So they say.

Eddard Stark : I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?

Eddard Stark : So why do you trust me now?

Eddard Stark : What sort of doom does the King face?

Eddard Stark : Who gave it to him?

Eddard Stark : The squire, Ser Hugh?

Eddard Stark : If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?

Eddard Stark : Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?

Eddard Stark : You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.

Eddard Stark : Who did?

Eddard Stark : Oh, Arya.

Eddard Stark : Where did you hear this?

Eddard Stark : What were you doing in the dungeons?

Eddard Stark : Your name, friend?

Eddard Stark : Did Benjen send you?

Eddard Stark : Ah, we'll find recruits for you.

Eddard Stark : Know what?

Eddard Stark : Go on. We'll talk more later.

Eddard Stark : Jory, take her safely to her room.

Eddard Stark : Well?

Tyrion Lannister : The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.

Tyrion Lannister : I like you.

Eddard Stark : I need to see the King first -- alone.

Eddard Stark : Is it about my wife?

Eddard Stark : You're speaking of murdering a child.

Eddard Stark : You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.

Eddard Stark : Then we're no better than the Mad King.

Eddard Stark : You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?

Eddard Stark : Based on whose information?

Eddard Stark : Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?

Eddard Stark : He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?

Eddard Stark : The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.

Eddard Stark : I followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.

Eddard Stark : I will have no part in it.

Eddard Stark : And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.

Eddard Stark : I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.

Eddard Stark : What can I do for you?

Eddard Stark : Why? What do you care?

Eddard Stark : I don't have the time.

Eddard Stark : Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?

Eddard Stark : Find them and meet me at the stables.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.

Tyrion Lannister : If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do.

Eddard Stark : I will.

Eddard Stark : When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?

Eddard Stark : She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.

Eddard Stark : What do you know of King Robert's bastards?

Eddard Stark : How many?

Eddard Stark : And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?

Eddard Stark : Come.

Eddard Stark : Jory!

Eddard Stark : I remember him well.

Eddard Stark : He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.

Eddard Stark : You kill me, your brother's a dead man.

Eddard Stark : Your pardon, your Grace.

Eddard Stark : She did nothing I did not command.

Eddard Stark : I am the King's Hand -

Eddard Stark : trying to keep the peace -

Eddard Stark : He butchered my men.

Eddard Stark : Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.

Eddard Stark : If we don't act. there will be a war.

Eddard Stark : And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?

Eddard Stark : As you command your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.

Eddard Stark : The hunt?

Eddard Stark : The Targaryen girl -

Tyrion Lannister : Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!

Tyrion Lannister : How would you like to be rich?

Tyrion Lannister : My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I'm prepared to give you lots of gold.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, I don't have it here.

Tyrion Lannister : Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!

Tyrion Lannister : About the gold -

Tyrion Lannister : Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession. is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.

Tyrion Lannister : Where? I don't know where, but when they free me -

Tyrion Lannister : Have you ever heard the phrase "Rich as a Lannister"�? Of course you have. You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, "a Lannister always pays his debts."� If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.

Tyrion Lannister : Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, my lady. I do, my lady.

Tyrion Lannister : Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and. I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -

Tyrion Lannister : Confessing my crimes.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that.

Tyrion Lannister : Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's Justice? I'm accused and demand a trial.

Tyrion Lannister : I understand the law.

Tyrion Lannister : No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.

Tyrion Lannister : Agreed.

Tyrion Lannister : Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.

Tyrion Lannister : I wouldn't be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister : Send a raven for him, I'm happy to wait.

Tyrion Lannister : Do I have a volunteer?

Tyrion Lannister : Anyone?... Anyone?

Eddard Stark : These men, were they flying a sigil? . A banner.

Eddard Stark : You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.

Eddard Stark : I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion.

Eddard Stark : You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.

Eddard Stark : In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.

Eddard Stark : Grand Maester Pycelle.

Eddard Stark : Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm.

Eddard Stark : Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?

Tyrion Lannister : Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.

Tyrion Lannister : A Lannister always pays his debts.

Eddard Stark : I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.

Eddard Stark : Listen -

Eddard Stark : What? No.

Eddard Stark : This isn't a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.

Eddard Stark : When you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone who's brave and gentle and strong -

Eddard Stark : Go on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things.

Eddard Stark : Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair."� "Axel Baratheon, black of hair."� "Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair."� "Steffon Baratheon, black of hair."� "Robert Baratheon, black of hair."� "Joffrey Baratheon. golden-haired."�

Eddard Stark : I've had worse, my lady.

Eddard Stark : The South doesn't seem to agree with you.

Eddard Stark : I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.

Eddard Stark : Has he done this before?

Eddard Stark : Your brother Or your lover?

Eddard Stark : My son saw you with him.

Eddard Stark : With all my heart.

Eddard Stark : And they are all Jaime's.

Eddard Stark : You've always hated him.

Eddard Stark : When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.

Eddard Stark : I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them.

Jon Snow : Why is he alone?

Jon Snow : There's no rider.

Jon Snow : That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.

Eddard Stark : You damned fool.

Eddard Stark : I will.

Eddard Stark : I'll, I'll do everything I can to honor your memory.

Eddard Stark : Give him milk of the poppy.

Eddard Stark : No man could have protected him from himself.

Eddard Stark : His squire? The Lannister boy?

Eddard Stark : His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.

Jon Snow : I do, my lord.

Jon Snow : Yes, my lord.

Jon Snow : Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.

Jon Snow : Do you take me for a servant?

Jon Snow : May I go?

Jon Snow : I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.

Jon Snow : I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger.

Eddard Stark : And what should I do with a hundred swords?

Eddard Stark : What about Stannis?

Eddard Stark : Stannis is your older brother.

Eddard Stark : Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice.

Eddard Stark : I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.

Eddard Stark : You will sail to dragonstone tonight.

Eddard Stark : Now leave us.

Eddard Stark : The King has no true born sons.

Eddard Stark : The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.

Eddard Stark : There is no "unless".

Eddard Stark : Do you have a shred of honor?

Eddard Stark : We?

Eddard Stark : What you suggest is treason.

Eddard Stark : Make peace with the Lannisters, you say. With the people who tried to murder my boy..

Eddard Stark : No. I won't do it.

Eddard Stark : There is no other choice. He is the heir.

Eddard Stark : You promised Catelyn you would help me.

Eddard Stark : Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm.

Eddard Stark : Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody.

Eddard Stark : I want no bloodshed.

Eddard Stark : Varys.

Eddard Stark : What about my daughters?

Eddard Stark : And Sansa?

Eddard Stark : You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.

Eddard Stark : The madness of mercy. That she might save her children.

Eddard Stark : The Queen can't kill me. Cat holds her brother.

Eddard Stark : If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.

Eddard Stark : Tell me something, Varys.

Jon Snow : Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say.

Jon Snow : We should burn them.

Jon Snow : Is there any word of my father?

Jon Snow : My sisters were in King's Landing too.

Tyrion Lannister : From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.

Tyrion Lannister : And feed it to the goats, yes.

Tyrion Lannister : Uncle. Father.

Tyrion Lannister : Sorry to disappoint you.

Tyrion Lannister : May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister : We have our differences, Jaime and I.

Tyrion Lannister : And the Starks? Lord Eddard?

Tyrion Lannister : How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?

Tyrion Lannister : My sister rules, you mean.

Tyrion Lannister : Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.

Eddard Stark : Another visit? lt seems you're my last friend.

Eddard Stark : On her knees begging for me. Hm! Did you laugh with the others?

Eddard Stark : l don't know what you want. l've given up trying to guess.

Eddard Stark : Huh. Can you free me from this pit?

Eddard Stark : What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories. Tell me, what do you want?

Eddard Stark : Robb? He's just a boy.

Eddard Stark : Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.

Eddard Stark : You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?

Eddard Stark : You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.

Jon Snow : Soon, he says.

Jon Snow : This is Valyrian steel.

Jon Snow : My lord, you honor me, but l can't -

Jon Snow : Yes, my lord.

Jon Snow : l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.

Jon Snow : At what?

Jon Snow : What is it?

Jon Snow : You can't what?

Jon Snow : And yet you really want to say. You want to say that.

Jon Snow : What? What about him?

Jon Snow : l should be there. l should be with him.

Jon Snow : Sam said you wanted to see me?

Jon Snow : No.

Jon Snow : He would do whatever was right, no matter what.

Jon Snow : Sam told you.

Jon Snow : And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?

Jon Snow : You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother.

Jon Snow : Who are you?

Jon Snow : You're Aemon Targaryen.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.

Tyrion Lannister : Shagga likes axes.

Tyrion Lannister : The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?

Tyrion Lannister : Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.

Tyrion Lannister : Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.

Tyrion Lannister : lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords.

Tyrion Lannister : Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?

Tyrion Lannister : Took her? From whom?

Tyrion Lannister : And he didn't have anything to say about it?

Tyrion Lannister : Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.

Tyrion Lannister : Who are you?

Tyrion Lannister : What did your mother call you?

Tyrion Lannister : My mother died giving birth to me.

Tyrion Lannister : What sort of accent is that?

Tyrion Lannister : For-

Tyrion Lannister : What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be.

Tyrion Lannister : One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular.

Tyrion Lannister : And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?

Tyrion Lannister : No.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?

Tyrion Lannister : Let's play a new game.

Tyrion Lannister : Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?

Tyrion Lannister : No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at.

Tyrion Lannister : l happen to be a great judge of character.

Tyrion Lannister : lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying.

Tyrion Lannister : Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.

Tyrion Lannister : You killed your first man before you were 12.

Tyrion Lannister : You've been north of the Wall.

Tyrion Lannister : And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.

Tyrion Lannister : lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.

Tyrion Lannister : All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.

Tyrion Lannister : And we've established the rules about lying?

Tyrion Lannister : You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.

Tyrion Lannister : So, specifics. You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?

Tyrion Lannister : Are you sure -

Tyrion Lannister : My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize.

Tyrion Lannister : Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.

Tyrion Lannister : That's not how the game works.

Tyrion Lannister : How did you hear that?

Tyrion Lannister : Another night, perhaps.

Tyrion Lannister : lt's not a pleasant story.

Tyrion Lannister : So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed.

Tyrion Lannister : lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father.

Tyrion Lannister : Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.

Tyrion Lannister : Really? l was 16, drunk and in love.

Tyrion Lannister : As l said, l was young and stupid.

Tyrion Lannister : What is it? What do you want?

Tyrion Lannister : What?

Tyrion Lannister : Get my squire!

Tyrion Lannister : lf l die, weep for me.

Tyrion Lannister : l'll know.

Tyrion Lannister : Stay low?

Tyrion Lannister : l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!

Tyrion Lannister : To battle!

Tyrion Lannister : l'm alive?

Tyrion Lannister : Did we win?

Tyrion Lannister : How did our tribesmen do?

Tyrion Lannister : lt's nice to see them getting along.

Tyrion Lannister : Good of you to notice. l hear we won.

Tyrion Lannister : Did we get the Stark boy, at least?

Tyrion Lannister : Where was he?

Tyrion Lannister : And where are they?

Tyrion Lannister : The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.

Tyrion Lannister : There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning - in case you hadn't noticed.

Tyrion Lannister : Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.

Tyrion Lannister : And do what?

Tyrion Lannister : Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?

Jon Snow : Get out of my way, Sam.

Jon Snow : Better than you do.

Jon Snow : l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.

Jon Snow : Move.

Jon Snow : Hyah!

Tyrion Lannister : So it would seem.

Tyrion Lannister : No, he said l couldn't take with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point.

Tyrion Lannister : What?

Tyrion Lannister : l believe he used the word "whore".

Tyrion Lannister : My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hando s lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand -

Jon Snow : Ghost?

Jon Snow : l belong with my brother.

Jon Snow : They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.

Jon Snow : l have to.

Jon Snow : I don't care about -

Jon Snow : To hell with all of you.

Jon Snow : My friends brought me back.

Jon Snow : They killed my father.

Jon Snow : No.

Jon Snow : Beyond the Wall?

Tyrion Lannister : Beloved nephew.

Tyrion Lannister : We looked for you on the battlefield. . You were nowhere to be found.

Tyrion Lannister : What a fine job you've done. . Look at you. . More beautiful than ever. . And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. . This one doesn't like me.

Tyrion Lannister : Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. . My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss.

Tyrion Lannister : But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course you are.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, , enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done.

Tyrion Lannister : Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. . War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on.

Tyrion Lannister : It's been a remarkable journey. I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. . I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, but in his absence.

Tyrion Lannister : If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. .

Tyrion Lannister : Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.

Tyrion Lannister : Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.

Tyrion Lannister : Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?

Tyrion Lannister : Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.

Tyrion Lannister : Joffrey is King.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back.

Tyrion Lannister : You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.

Tyrion Lannister : One?

Tyrion Lannister : Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child.

Jon Snow : Having a rough time of it?

Jon Snow : What happens to the boys?

Jon Snow : He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?

Jon Snow : We're not Southerners.

Jon Snow : Jon Snow.

Jon Snow : Lord commander.

Jon Snow : Your steward.

Tyrion Lannister : A bit corpsey, yes.

Tyrion Lannister : I thought you wanted to come here.

Tyrion Lannister : You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?

Tyrion Lannister : You can smell cum from the balcony?

Tyrion Lannister : And so did the country.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here.

Tyrion Lannister : You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars.

Tyrion Lannister : Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.

Tyrion Lannister : Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, , crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.

Tyrion Lannister : Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here.

Tyrion Lannister : You brought this on yourself.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you understand we're losing the war?

Jon Snow : What happens to the boys? What does he do with his sons?

Tyrion Lannister : It was quite a battle.

Tyrion Lannister : Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.

Tyrion Lannister : Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. .

Tyrion Lannister : Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't like threats.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.

Tyrion Lannister : And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.

Tyrion Lannister : You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith.

Tyrion Lannister : Safe travels, cousin.

Tyrion Lannister : You have a deft hand with diplomacy.

Tyrion Lannister : Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.

Tyrion Lannister : Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them.

Tyrion Lannister : According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. . Mormont doesn't lie.

Tyrion Lannister : Apparently you burn him.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall.

Jon Snow : What're you doing?

Jon Snow : Hello, Gilly. What're you doing?

Jon Snow : I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -

Jon Snow : What? .

Jon Snow : No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible.

Jon Snow : Sam we can't take her -

Jon Snow : It's just not possible.

Jon Snow : If it's a boy what? . You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why.

Jon Snow : Do what, ask her a question?

Jon Snow : Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?

Jon Snow : No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?

Jon Snow : We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?

Jon Snow : I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her.

Tyrion Lannister : Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine.

Tyrion Lannister : Myself, I prefer the improper ones.

Tyrion Lannister : You know your wines, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Wars have been started for less.

Tyrion Lannister : I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies.

Tyrion Lannister : Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.

Tyrion Lannister : No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman.

Tyrion Lannister : You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.

Tyrion Lannister : That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children.

Tyrion Lannister : I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.

Tyrion Lannister : The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence.

Tyrion Lannister : Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here.

Tyrion Lannister : I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.

Tyrion Lannister : The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.

Tyrion Lannister : No, we shan't.

Tyrion Lannister : There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way.

Tyrion Lannister : His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.

Tyrion Lannister : To the new Commander.

Tyrion Lannister : If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?

Tyrion Lannister : I have every right. I am the King's Hand.

Tyrion Lannister : Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?

Tyrion Lannister : You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, "The Queen slaughters babies."� . You don't even have the decency to deny it.

Tyrion Lannister : It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that.

Tyrion Lannister : As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon.

Tyrion Lannister : She was my mother too.

Jon Snow : Lord Commander-

Jon Snow : I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn.

Jon Snow : No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys...

Jon Snow : You know.

Jon Snow : Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.

Jon Snow : I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child.

Tyrion Lannister : Keep your voice down.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.

Tyrion Lannister : Again, only temporary.

Tyrion Lannister : But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.

Tyrion Lannister : Kitchen wench.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, but-

Tyrion Lannister : Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.

Tyrion Lannister : It's a compliment, my lady.

Tyrion Lannister : Language can be a bit tricky here.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.

Tyrion Lannister : Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.

Tyrion Lannister : Please.

Tyrion Lannister : I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?

Tyrion Lannister : These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it.

Tyrion Lannister : But remember, the Queen mustn't know.

Tyrion Lannister : I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.

Tyrion Lannister : Precisely.

Tyrion Lannister : Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.

Tyrion Lannister : But remember, you must tell no one.

Tyrion Lannister : I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.

Tyrion Lannister : For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?

Tyrion Lannister : Who better?

Tyrion Lannister : The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal.

Tyrion Lannister : Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.

Tyrion Lannister : You served my family well in the matter of the succession.

Tyrion Lannister : I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?

Tyrion Lannister : Good. Oh. And remember-

Tyrion Lannister : Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.

Tyrion Lannister : Dorne is the safest place for her.

Tyrion Lannister : That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.

Tyrion Lannister : A guest.

Tyrion Lannister : It's done, Cersei.

Tyrion Lannister : You cannot stop it.

Tyrion Lannister : Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.

Tyrion Lannister : No, afraid not. Sorry about that.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in.

Tyrion Lannister : No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?

Tyrion Lannister : Find him?

Tyrion Lannister : No, you don't.

Tyrion Lannister : You disappoint me, Grand Maester.

Tyrion Lannister : So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.

Tyrion Lannister : See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you.

Tyrion Lannister : Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, make do.

Tyrion Lannister : How long have you been spying for my sister?

Tyrion Lannister : I don't like his beard.

Tyrion Lannister : How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?

Tyrion Lannister : So you poisoned him?

Tyrion Lannister : But you let him die, made sure he succumbed.

Tyrion Lannister : Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.

Tyrion Lannister : For your trouble.

Tyrion Lannister : Good. One of my better ideas.

Tyrion Lannister : The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.

Tyrion Lannister : Why, am I about to hear one?

Tyrion Lannister : Depends on the sellsword.

Tyrion Lannister : He has a sword, the power of life and death.

Tyrion Lannister : I've decided I don't like riddles.

Tyrion Lannister : What is the meaning of this?

Tyrion Lannister : What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?

Tyrion Lannister : Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?

Tyrion Lannister : For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit.

Tyrion Lannister : The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?

Tyrion Lannister : I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?

Tyrion Lannister : Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.

Tyrion Lannister : You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?

Tyrion Lannister : Your visits are too few, cousin.

Tyrion Lannister : So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.

Tyrion Lannister : If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?

Tyrion Lannister : And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?

Tyrion Lannister : And you've waited this long to deliver the information?

Tyrion Lannister : Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf.

Tyrion Lannister : She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.

Tyrion Lannister : An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?

Tyrion Lannister : Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?

Tyrion Lannister : Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?

Tyrion Lannister : Did he tell you to fuck her, too?

Tyrion Lannister : Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.

Tyrion Lannister : Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.

Tyrion Lannister : No, I think not.

Tyrion Lannister : You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length.

Tyrion Lannister : Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.

Tyrion Lannister : Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea.

Tyrion Lannister : And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later.

Tyrion Lannister : She'll be safer in Dorne.

Tyrion Lannister : It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you.

Tyrion Lannister : Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.

Tyrion Lannister : May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?

Tyrion Lannister : It's important that we talk about this.

Tyrion Lannister : Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?

Tyrion Lannister : MThat's a lie right there.

Tyrion Lannister : Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.

Tyrion Lannister : The smart money would be on more likely.

Tyrion Lannister : But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.

Tyrion Lannister : I suppose there's only one way to find out.

Tyrion Lannister : When did she tell you this?

Tyrion Lannister : Swear to me on what?

Tyrion Lannister : But I don't care about your life.

Tyrion Lannister : All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me.

Tyrion Lannister : Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?

Tyrion Lannister : Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it.

Tyrion Lannister : He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.

Tyrion Lannister : It's hard to argue with his assessment.

Tyrion Lannister : The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.

Tyrion Lannister : You have to admire his imagination.

Tyrion Lannister : What? Demon monkey?

Tyrion Lannister : Blame me? I'm trying to save them.

Tyrion Lannister : Demon monkey.

Jon Snow : When will he come?

Jon Snow : My uncle told me stories about him.

Jon Snow : I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.

Jon Snow : So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.

Jon Snow : I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.

Jon Snow : One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.

Jon Snow : Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand.

Tyrion Lannister : I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, "Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. "

Tyrion Lannister : My companion takes issue.

Tyrion Lannister : How much do you have?

Tyrion Lannister : My friend remains unconvinced.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me.

Jon Snow : A fire.

Jon Snow : Where?

Jon Snow : Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.

Jon Snow : I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?

Jon Snow : Ghost, stay with us. Ghost!

Jon Snow : He's not a pet.

Jon Snow : Ghost is different.

Jon Snow : I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.

Jon Snow : We could do the same.

Jon Snow : My father always said I'm of the North.

Jon Snow : I wasn't joking.

Jon Snow : I'll gladly give my life.

Jon Snow : I do.

Jon Snow : A girl.

Jon Snow : We could question her.

Jon Snow : What's your name?

Jon Snow : I'm Jon Snow.

Jon Snow : No. No, I'll do it.

Jon Snow : I'm as much a crow as they are.

Jon Snow : Can't. Someone might see the smoke.

Jon Snow : I'll find them.

Tyrion Lannister : Get the Prince back to the Keep now.

Tyrion Lannister : Move. Move!

Tyrion Lannister : Where's Sansa?

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, you blind, bloody fool!

Tyrion Lannister : We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king.

Tyrion Lannister : I can, I am.

Tyrion Lannister : They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool! All because of a war you started.

Tyrion Lannister : And now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl?

Tyrion Lannister : If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back! You owe him quite a bit, you know.

Tyrion Lannister : Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.

Tyrion Lannister : Are you hurt, my lady?

Tyrion Lannister : Well done, Clegane.

Jon Snow : We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today.

Jon Snow : There's no shelter anywhere.

Jon Snow : No fire.

Jon Snow : Yes.

Jon Snow : We start again at first light. Get some sleep.

Jon Snow : Stop moving.

Jon Snow : Stop it!

Jon Snow : You're still moving.

Jon Snow : Let's move.

Jon Snow : I'm a man of the Night's Watch.

Jon Snow : Don't call them that.

Jon Snow : Neither. Both.

Jon Snow : Move!

Jon Snow : There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.

Jon Snow : No.

Jon Snow : Never. We swore an oath.

Jon Snow : Would you please shut up?

Jon Snow : You're a free woman?

Jon Snow : If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what "prisoner" means.

Jon Snow : It was my choice to say the words.

Jon Snow : Of course I like girls.

Jon Snow : That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.

Jon Snow : Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!

Jon Snow : My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours.

Jon Snow : No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall.

Jon Snow : Walk.

Jon Snow : I know how to do it.

Jon Snow : We're close.

Jon Snow : Nothing happened between you and me.

Jon Snow : Turn back around.

Jon Snow : What, right here in the muck?

Jon Snow : That's enough.

Jon Snow : Enough!

Tyrion Lannister : Since when do you light your own candles?

Tyrion Lannister : Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind.

Tyrion Lannister : Rain fire on them from above." You're quoting Father, aren't you?

Tyrion Lannister : Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.

Tyrion Lannister : He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead

Tyrion Lannister : I thought the girls might help him.

Tyrion Lannister : I was wrong. If we can't control him

Tyrion Lannister : It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.

Tyrion Lannister : The boy is more Robert than Jaime.

Tyrion Lannister : Sins?

Tyrion Lannister : You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them.

Jon Snow : I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't-

Jon Snow : The others?

Jon Snow : They died because of me.

Jon Snow : They'll never trust me.

Jon Snow : What?

Jon Snow : I didn't.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you have to do that here?

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, but do you have to do it here?

Tyrion Lannister : You should start wearing the gold cloak.

Tyrion Lannister : You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common

Tyrion Lannister : Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out.

Tyrion Lannister : Fine, fine. No gold cloak.

Tyrion Lannister : What?

Tyrion Lannister : What? What? Why are you staring at me?

Tyrion Lannister : To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.

Tyrion Lannister : Stannis will be here any day.

Tyrion Lannister : An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. " By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh.

Tyrion Lannister : I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?

Tyrion Lannister : For questioning?

Tyrion Lannister : We talked about this.

Tyrion Lannister : Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land.

Tyrion Lannister : Pig shit.

Tyrion Lannister : Thank you, Podrick.

Tyrion Lannister : I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.

Tyrion Lannister : Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.

Tyrion Lannister : Younger boys are off fighting his war.

Tyrion Lannister : What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?

Tyrion Lannister : It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us.

Tyrion Lannister : No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence.

Tyrion Lannister : He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?

Tyrion Lannister : Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.

Tyrion Lannister : Neither do you.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not that little.

Tyrion Lannister : Why are you smiling?

Tyrion Lannister : And why are you happy?

Tyrion Lannister : I thought you preferred blondes.

Tyrion Lannister : Why do you care who I fuck?

Tyrion Lannister : This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.

Tyrion Lannister : Where did you find her?

Tyrion Lannister : You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.

Tyrion Lannister : You don't buy them, you only rent them.

Tyrion Lannister : And how do I know you haven't killed her already?

Tyrion Lannister : I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.

Tyrion Lannister : I promise I will free you.

Tyrion Lannister : Never.

Tyrion Lannister : I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid.

Tyrion Lannister : Shae!

Tyrion Lannister : You're beautiful.

Tyrion Lannister : We have to be more careful.

Tyrion Lannister : There are people who want to hurt me.

Tyrion Lannister : I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.

Tyrion Lannister : Promise me.

Tyrion Lannister : To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

Tyrion Lannister : A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you.

Tyrion Lannister : Imagine Stannis' terror.

Tyrion Lannister : You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.

Tyrion Lannister : I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men.

Tyrion Lannister : What do you want? Tell me.

Tyrion Lannister : My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

Tyrion Lannister : The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand

Tyrion Lannister : I do. Last thing I expected.

Tyrion Lannister : I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over.

Tyrion Lannister : The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?

Tyrion Lannister : We should sail there immediately.

Tyrion Lannister : A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.

Tyrion Lannister : One game at a time, my friend.

Tyrion Lannister : If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.

Tyrion Lannister : You can't fuck your way out of everything.

Tyrion Lannister : A wedding.

Tyrion Lannister : Is that it?" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.

Tyrion Lannister : Oddly enough, I do.

Tyrion Lannister : There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, I'm not.

Tyrion Lannister : What of it?

Tyrion Lannister : Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?

Tyrion Lannister : Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself.

Tyrion Lannister : No, I don't believe you have.

Tyrion Lannister : Remember, wait till the ships-

Tyrion Lannister : They must be far enough in-

Tyrion Lannister : I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood.

Tyrion Lannister : Nor you, my friend.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh! "Enhances." Fancy word for a sellsword.

Tyrion Lannister : Lady Sansa and Sheila.

Tyrion Lannister : Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.

Tyrion Lannister : Always been a great romantic, my nephew.

Tyrion Lannister : Will you?

Tyrion Lannister : Stay safe, my lady.

Tyrion Lannister : On the way.

Tyrion Lannister : Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy.

Tyrion Lannister : That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet.

Tyrion Lannister : Archers to their marks.

Tyrion Lannister : Hold fast.

Tyrion Lannister : He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon.

Tyrion Lannister : Rain fire on them.

Tyrion Lannister : Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now.

Tyrion Lannister : Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?

Tyrion Lannister : You're on the wrong side of the wall.

Tyrion Lannister : You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city.

Tyrion Lannister : If you won't defend your own city, why should they?

Tyrion Lannister : Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.

Tyrion Lannister : I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!

Tyrion Lannister : Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?

Tyrion Lannister : There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.

Tyrion Lannister : Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape.

Tyrion Lannister : Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.

Tyrion Lannister : Attack!

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, fuck me.

Tyrion Lannister : Pod.

Tyrion Lannister : Pod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive.

Tyrion Lannister : What happened?

Tyrion Lannister : Where am I?

Tyrion Lannister : Why should I believe you?

Tyrion Lannister : To create strife between my sister and me.

Tyrion Lannister : Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?

Tyrion Lannister : You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times.

Tyrion Lannister : Then my hill tribesmen.

Tyrion Lannister : Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.

Tyrion Lannister : It was good of you to come.

Tyrion Lannister : Believe me, you don't.

Tyrion Lannister : Well?

Tyrion Lannister : I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double.

Tyrion Lannister : That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me.

Tyrion Lannister : Leave?

Tyrion Lannister : What would we do in Pentos?

Tyrion Lannister : I want to go with you.

Tyrion Lannister : I can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Out-talking them, out-thinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave?

Jon Snow : Careful with that. You might cut yourself.

Jon Snow : Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle.

Jon Snow : Stop!

Jon Snow : Mance was a ranger.

Jon Snow : When I'm free, will I be free to go?

Jon Snow : What happened to their fathers?

Jon Snow : My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.

Jon Snow : Jon Snow.

Jon Snow : Your Grace.

Jon Snow : The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.

Jon Snow : He wants me to lead one day.

Jon Snow : If I'm a traitor, then you are, too.

Jon Snow : I want to be free.

Jon Snow : We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...

Jon Snow : I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.

Jon Snow : Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?

Tyrion Lannister : Pod?

Tyrion Lannister : What are they doing here?

Tyrion Lannister : No, I don't think so.

Tyrion Lannister : They stay outside.

Tyrion Lannister : Why are you here?

Tyrion Lannister : The man who cut me lost more than his nose.

Tyrion Lannister : Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me.

Tyrion Lannister : Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.

Tyrion Lannister : How do you know that?

Tyrion Lannister : What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came.

Tyrion Lannister : Why do you care what I want from him?

Tyrion Lannister : Slandered? When?

Tyrion Lannister : You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe.

Tyrion Lannister : She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not slander if it's true.

Tyrion Lannister : Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?

Tyrion Lannister : Any lies in particular?

Tyrion Lannister : Still makes me more clever than you.

Tyrion Lannister : A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you grow bored protecting me?

Tyrion Lannister : Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm sure you filled your pockets.

Tyrion Lannister : I thought we were friends.

Tyrion Lannister : How much?

Tyrion Lannister : Double?

Tyrion Lannister : I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.

Tyrion Lannister : The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?

Tyrion Lannister : I was very happy as Hand of the King.

Tyrion Lannister : It wasn't your bed at the time.

Tyrion Lannister : Occasionally I drank with the harlots.

Tyrion Lannister : Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.

Tyrion Lannister : I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start.

Tyrion Lannister : I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir.

Tyrion Lannister : It is mine by right.

Tyrion Lannister : Why?

Jon Snow : Don't think too much, Bran.

Jon Snow : Relax your bow arm.

Eddard Stark : And which one of you was a marksman at ten?

Jon Snow : Yes.

Jon Snow : I understand.

Jon Snow : You want to protect your people.

Jon Snow : No.

Jon Snow : What's wrong with him?

Tyrion Lannister : We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.

Tyrion Lannister : Did anyone see you? No.

Tyrion Lannister : You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.

Tyrion Lannister : All right. What is this problem?

Tyrion Lannister : Baelish doesn't have friends.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, Ros? The redhead?

Tyrion Lannister : I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice.

Tyrion Lannister : But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else.

Tyrion Lannister : Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?

Tyrion Lannister : Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?

Tyrion Lannister : We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't even want to talk about her.

Tyrion Lannister : Only because you're making me.

Tyrion Lannister : This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.

Tyrion Lannister : Hmm, yes.

Tyrion Lannister : Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.

Tyrion Lannister : Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.

Tyrion Lannister : Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended.

Tyrion Lannister : Master of Coin?

Tyrion Lannister : I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it.

Jon Snow : It's only horses. No men.

Jon Snow : About three hundred.

Jon Snow : Do you think anyone got away?

Tyrion Lannister : A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.

Tyrion Lannister : Not for bastards.

Tyrion Lannister : Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment.

Tyrion Lannister : Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid.

Tyrion Lannister : If only the Master of Coin had such power.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding.

Tyrion Lannister : We don't. I did fuck her once.

Tyrion Lannister : But we don't.

Tyrion Lannister : Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?

Tyrion Lannister : If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are.

Tyrion Lannister : Good point.

Tyrion Lannister : I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie.

Tyrion Lannister : You think all reading is dull reading.

Tyrion Lannister : The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.

Tyrion Lannister : Unless he made it all up, yes. Podrick, do keep up.

Tyrion Lannister : Podrick.

Tyrion Lannister : After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?

Tyrion Lannister : Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers.

Tyrion Lannister : A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?

Tyrion Lannister : Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me.

Tyrion Lannister : Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.

Tyrion Lannister : She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Be back in time for my supper.

Tyrion Lannister : For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold.

Tyrion Lannister : No.

Tyrion Lannister : Worse, he's borrowing it.

Tyrion Lannister : We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father.

Tyrion Lannister : Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, you have to.

Tyrion Lannister : This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?

Tyrion Lannister : You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year.

Tyrion Lannister : Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.

Tyrion Lannister : What did you do to them?

Tyrion Lannister : And they seemed to like these things?

Tyrion Lannister : Only they weren't paid.

Tyrion Lannister : Is that what you're telling us?

Tyrion Lannister : Sit down, Podrick.

Tyrion Lannister : We're going to need details. Copious details.

Tyrion Lannister : I hope we might speak. In confidence.

Tyrion Lannister : About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?

Tyrion Lannister : I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-

Tyrion Lannister : I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof.

Tyrion Lannister : I need to know.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't know. Do I?

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-

Tyrion Lannister : The sorcerer.

Jon Snow : There are four to a patrol- two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies.

Jon Snow : It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you.

Jon Snow : Three.

Jon Snow : Castle Black.

Jon Snow : Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.

Jon Snow : A thousand.

Jon Snow : What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground?

Jon Snow : A thousand men.

Jon Snow : I don't need you to protect me.

Jon Snow : Give it back.

Jon Snow : Ygritte! Ygritte!

Jon Snow : Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte!

Jon Snow : Ygritte.

Jon Snow : We shouldn't.

Jon Snow : I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.

Jon Snow : You seemed to like it.

Jon Snow : There's been no one else. Only you.

Jon Snow : I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?

Jon Snow : Who was he?

Jon Snow : Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund-

Tyrion Lannister : Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters.

Tyrion Lannister : It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.

Tyrion Lannister : It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.

Tyrion Lannister : I understand that.

Tyrion Lannister : But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense.

Tyrion Lannister : And we're at war, Lady Olenna.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, and maintaining supply lines-

Tyrion Lannister : And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.

Tyrion Lannister : I would.

Tyrion Lannister : My lady-

Tyrion Lannister : Quite sufficient. Thank you.

Tyrion Lannister : Give me that.

Tyrion Lannister : What's she doing here?

Tyrion Lannister : You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.

Tyrion Lannister : Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.

Tyrion Lannister : Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.

Tyrion Lannister : It wasn't my best, but-

Tyrion Lannister : Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.

Tyrion Lannister : The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?

Tyrion Lannister : And how do we do that?

Tyrion Lannister : Wonderful.

Tyrion Lannister : You can't mean it.

Tyrion Lannister : Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.

Tyrion Lannister : She's a child!

Tyrion Lannister : And if I refuse?

Tyrion Lannister : I was wed. Or don't you remember?

Jon Snow : You ever climbed it before?

Jon Snow : Aren't you?

Jon Snow : You kill someone for them?

Jon Snow : Can we not talk about that here?

Jon Snow : Did I seem scared the other day?

Jon Snow : Only in the beginning.

Jon Snow : What secret?

Jon Snow : I won't.

Jon Snow : Take my hand!

Tyrion Lannister : I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.

Tyrion Lannister : It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.

Tyrion Lannister : On a boat you built.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.

Tyrion Lannister : Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?

Tyrion Lannister : The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot.

Tyrion Lannister : I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.

Tyrion Lannister : Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister : You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels.

Tyrion Lannister : Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.

Tyrion Lannister : I beg your pardon, my lady.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.

Tyrion Lannister : Alone, if I may.

Tyrion Lannister : Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.

Tyrion Lannister : How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.

Jon Snow : About a week, I think.

Jon Snow : When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad.

Jon Snow : Most of the time, yes.

Jon Snow : They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.

Jon Snow : Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.

Jon Snow : They help the men march.

Jon Snow : Well, it's- it's the rhythm.

Jon Snow : No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming.

Jon Snow : I know you cut me loose on the Wall.

Jon Snow : And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?

Tyrion Lannister : She's a child.

Tyrion Lannister : A tall child.

Tyrion Lannister : Not that young.

Tyrion Lannister : Older.

Tyrion Lannister : Shae isn't going to like it.

Tyrion Lannister : I should never have told you about that.

Tyrion Lannister : Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.

Tyrion Lannister : Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.

Tyrion Lannister : You could buy a ship with these.

Tyrion Lannister : What?

Tyrion Lannister : Of course you're not going anywhere.

Tyrion Lannister : I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.

Tyrion Lannister : That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't have a choice. My father-

Tyrion Lannister : What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.

Tyrion Lannister : My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.

Tyrion Lannister : I swear to you it will not be like that.

Tyrion Lannister : I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for.

Tyrion Lannister : Listen. Listen to me, my lady.

Tyrion Lannister : You are. You'll always be my lady.

Jon Snow : You're gonna scare it off.

Jon Snow : It's too far away.

Jon Snow : It's a windmill.

Jon Snow : Just the men who used to live here.

Jon Snow : Winterfell has towers three times that size.

Jon Snow : If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell.

Jon Snow : Fainting.

Jon Snow : When a girl sees blood and collapses.

Jon Snow : Well not all girls are like you.

Jon Snow : I'd like to see you in a silk dress.

Jon Snow : So I could tear it off you.

Jon Snow : Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.

Jon Snow : Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that.

Jon Snow : Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed.

Jon Snow : Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same.

Jon Snow : You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.

Jon Snow : I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you.

Jon Snow : Yes, first we'll live.

Tyrion Lannister : Lady Sansa.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?

Tyrion Lannister : My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this.

Tyrion Lannister : No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel.

Tyrion Lannister : You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.

Tyrion Lannister : But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?

Tyrion Lannister : Well, today you have to.

Tyrion Lannister : Could you-

Tyrion Lannister : Thank you.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course. Of course. En-enjoy.

Tyrion Lannister : Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?

Tyrion Lannister : And?

Tyrion Lannister : What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.

Tyrion Lannister : There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit.

Tyrion Lannister : There will be no bedding ceremony.

Tyrion Lannister : Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.

Tyrion Lannister : A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there.

Tyrion Lannister : I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.

Tyrion Lannister : My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife.

Tyrion Lannister : I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood.

Tyrion Lannister : Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion.

Tyrion Lannister : Nothing was ever wiser.

Tyrion Lannister : Astoundingly long.

Tyrion Lannister : Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?

Tyrion Lannister : Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage.

Tyrion Lannister : Stop. I can't. I could, I won't.

Tyrion Lannister : If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to.

Tyrion Lannister : And so my watch begins.

Tyrion Lannister : You really ought to knock.

Jon Snow : He breeds them for the Watch.

Jon Snow : The Watch protects him.

Jon Snow : We just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat.

Jon Snow : The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.

Jon Snow : Ygritte!

Jon Snow : You were right the whole time.

Tyrion Lannister : Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

Tyrion Lannister : I have a list.

Tyrion Lannister : For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-

Tyrion Lannister : My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp.

Tyrion Lannister : The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.

Tyrion Lannister : Who? Whom?

Tyrion Lannister : Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.

Tyrion Lannister : I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.

Tyrion Lannister : Lady Sansa!

Tyrion Lannister : Why sheep shift?

Tyrion Lannister : My lady-

Tyrion Lannister : Killed a few puppies today?

Tyrion Lannister : Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?

Tyrion Lannister : No. She is no longer yours to torment.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.

Tyrion Lannister : You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.

Tyrion Lannister : A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.

Tyrion Lannister : No. I think armies give you power.

Tyrion Lannister : Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm all for cheating. This is war.

Tyrion Lannister : So that's why you did it? To save lives?

Tyrion Lannister : The Northerners will never forget.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?

Tyrion Lannister : I will not rape her.

Tyrion Lannister : Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.

Tyrion Lannister : No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions.

Tyrion Lannister : When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?

Tyrion Lannister : Sansa.

Tyrion Lannister : Keep up.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy.

Tyrion Lannister : She doesn't deserve this.

Tyrion Lannister : There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.

Tyrion Lannister : Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?

Tyrion Lannister : I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.

Tyrion Lannister : So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?

Tyrion Lannister : You have children. How happy would you say you are?

Tyrion Lannister : Even Joffrey?

Tyrion Lannister : How long does it go on?

Tyrion Lannister : Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more.

Jon Snow : Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am.

Jon Snow : I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me.

Jon Snow : I do know some things. I know I love you.

Jon Snow : I know you love me. But I have to go home now.

Jon Snow : Pyp? Sam?

Tyrion Lannister : Please don't.

Tyrion Lannister : This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends.

Tyrion Lannister : There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.

Tyrion Lannister : No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah, here we are.

Tyrion Lannister : Can you read the sigils?

Tyrion Lannister : Boy knows his Dornish Houses.

Tyrion Lannister : And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?

Tyrion Lannister : Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast.

Tyrion Lannister : And where is Prince Oberyn?

Tyrion Lannister : Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep.

Tyrion Lannister : You must be weary after such a long journey.

Tyrion Lannister : We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.

Tyrion Lannister : You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?

Tyrion Lannister : Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be...

Tyrion Lannister : trouble.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm here to welcome you to the capital.

Tyrion Lannister : If there's anything I can do to make your stay...

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, I partook. Now I'm married.

Tyrion Lannister : Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, they take all kinds.

Tyrion Lannister : The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult.

Tyrion Lannister : Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?

Tyrion Lannister : I thought we were speaking truth.

Tyrion Lannister : I wasn't actually present.

Tyrion Lannister : I've heard rumors.

Tyrion Lannister : I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.

Tyrion Lannister : My lady, you do need to eat.

Tyrion Lannister : If I could have a moment alone with my wife.

Tyrion Lannister : I can't let you starve.

Tyrion Lannister : I swore to protect you.

Tyrion Lannister : My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't know, but I can try.

Tyrion Lannister : I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.

Tyrion Lannister : What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear.

Tyrion Lannister : What are you doing?

Tyrion Lannister : How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course I haven't forgotten.

Tyrion Lannister : Things are a bit tense right now.

Tyrion Lannister : My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister : I told you. It's not a good time.

Tyrion Lannister : Shae.

Tyrion Lannister : Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course I don't love her.

Tyrion Lannister : Ship you away?

Tyrion Lannister : What in the world are you talking about?

Tyrion Lannister : Shh. I don't know what you're talking about.

Jon Snow : Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. "He said, " Next time I see you, you'll be all in black." I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could.

Jon Snow : He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.

Jon Snow : I've done plenty wrong.

Jon Snow : I didn't murder him.

Jon Snow : He wanted me to kill him.

Jon Snow : The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.

Jon Snow : Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him...

Jon Snow : Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl.

Jon Snow : I do.

Jon Snow : While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000.

Jon Snow : 100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him.

Jon Snow : Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?

Jon Snow : And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.

Jon Snow : There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.

Jon Snow : Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?

Tyrion Lannister : Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?

Tyrion Lannister : You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.

Tyrion Lannister : You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her.

Tyrion Lannister : A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness.

Tyrion Lannister : It's only wine.

Tyrion Lannister : What about your left?

Tyrion Lannister : You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?

Tyrion Lannister : Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand.

Tyrion Lannister : You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one.

Tyrion Lannister : Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, to be foreign.

Tyrion Lannister : So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.

Tyrion Lannister : Forgive me if I don't weep for you.

Tyrion Lannister : She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it.

Tyrion Lannister : The Lives of Four Kings." Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read.

Tyrion Lannister : Don't.

Tyrion Lannister : Don't call me that.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.

Tyrion Lannister : There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.

Tyrion Lannister : You'll have your own cabin, of course, and, across the Narrow Sea, a house, servants.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows.

Tyrion Lannister : I need to do right by her.

Tyrion Lannister : By our children.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not afraid.

Tyrion Lannister : I need you to leave.

Tyrion Lannister : Shae.

Tyrion Lannister : You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? Five hundred? Five thousand?

Tyrion Lannister : I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.

Tyrion Lannister : You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.

Tyrion Lannister : Better her than you.

Tyrion Lannister : You saw her board the ship?

Tyrion Lannister : You saw the ship sail away?

Tyrion Lannister : How do you know?

Tyrion Lannister : There's someone following you?

Tyrion Lannister : Hello.

Tyrion Lannister : My lady. My lady.

Tyrion Lannister : Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.

Tyrion Lannister : We'll have to find another way to thank the king.

Tyrion Lannister : One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night.

Tyrion Lannister : A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace does me a great honor.

Tyrion Lannister : Let's find out.

Tyrion Lannister : I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace.

Tyrion Lannister : If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace?

Tyrion Lannister : Podrick. Apologies for the stench.

Tyrion Lannister : A noble effort.

Tyrion Lannister : You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?

Tyrion Lannister : I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?

Tyrion Lannister : Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?

Tyrion Lannister : No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?

Tyrion Lannister : Of course.

Tyrion Lannister : Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.

Tyrion Lannister : Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa.

Tyrion Lannister : Gone?

Tyrion Lannister : No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick.

Tyrion Lannister : They'll be following you now.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go.

Tyrion Lannister : Varys could vouch for me if he dared.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.

Tyrion Lannister : Why not?

Tyrion Lannister : And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?

Tyrion Lannister : Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?

Tyrion Lannister : Are you going to accept their offer?

Tyrion Lannister : Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet.

Tyrion Lannister : Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that.

Tyrion Lannister : I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted.

Tyrion Lannister : Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell.

Tyrion Lannister : Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.

Jon Snow : Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them.

Jon Snow : Help him.

Jon Snow : And the mutineers stayed?

Jon Snow : We need to ride north and kill them all.

Jon Snow : It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them.

Tyrion Lannister : Is that supposed to make me feel better?

Tyrion Lannister : It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?

Tyrion Lannister : Her son?

Tyrion Lannister : My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.

Tyrion Lannister : So, should I turn around and close my eyes?

Tyrion Lannister : The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?

Tyrion Lannister : Well, you could set me free.

Tyrion Lannister : Then there's really nothing else to say.

Tyrion Lannister : Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate.

Tyrion Lannister : Except I didn't do it.

Tyrion Lannister : Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?

Tyrion Lannister : No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway.

Jon Snow : Bring it through! And again.

Jon Snow : Very nice. Good.

Jon Snow : A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.

Jon Snow : Let's see what you can do.

Jon Snow : Olly, you just watch for now.

Jon Snow : Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.

Jon Snow : You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other.

Jon Snow : You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.

Jon Snow : Grenn and I were helping them.

Jon Snow : Someone has to train them.

Jon Snow : My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.

Jon Snow : Jon Snow.

Jon Snow : You fight well.

Jon Snow : She wasn't safe here.

Jon Snow : Castle Black could be next.

Jon Snow : We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.

Jon Snow : And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.

Jon Snow : How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?

Jon Snow : The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...

Jon Snow : Thank you, Ser Alliser.

Jon Snow : Ahem, brothers.

Jon Snow : I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?

Jon Snow : I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.

Jon Snow : Thank you, brothers.

Jon Snow : How many?

Jon Snow : Why?

Jon Snow : Get some rest. We move at sundown.

Jon Snow : Are you all right? Come with me. Come on.

Jon Snow : We lost four brothers?

Jon Snow : I count ten dead mutineers.

Jon Snow : Where in seven hells? Come here.

Jon Snow : I missed you, boy.

Jon Snow : It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.

Jon Snow : You want to stay here in Craster's Keep?

Tyrion Lannister : Let me guess, I've been pardoned.

Tyrion Lannister : Really?

Tyrion Lannister : Well, we mustn't disappoint Father.

Tyrion Lannister : No.

Tyrion Lannister : Not that I know of.

Tyrion Lannister : Choked on his pigeon pie.

Tyrion Lannister : Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?

Tyrion Lannister : Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.

Tyrion Lannister : Father, may I ask the witness one question?

Tyrion Lannister : You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?

Tyrion Lannister : Not going well, is it?

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, you think so?

Tyrion Lannister : Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.

Tyrion Lannister : How do you know?

Tyrion Lannister : Shae. Please don't.

Tyrion Lannister : Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess.

Tyrion Lannister : I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?

Tyrion Lannister : No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life.

Tyrion Lannister : Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had.

Tyrion Lannister : Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores.

Tyrion Lannister : I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.

Tyrion Lannister : I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?

Tyrion Lannister : Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son.

Tyrion Lannister : At least I got to tell them what they really are.

Tyrion Lannister : Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me.

Tyrion Lannister : Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall.

Tyrion Lannister : Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.

Tyrion Lannister : Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life.

Tyrion Lannister : Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.

Jon Snow : Greetings.

Jon Snow : Come on, Ghost.

Jon Snow : Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.

Jon Snow : We need to prepare.

Jon Snow : We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.

Jon Snow : We wouldn't.

Jon Snow : Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have.

Jon Snow : They won't stop them.

Jon Snow : The stewards.

Jon Snow : No.

Jon Snow : The builders.

Tyrion Lannister : You have new clothes.

Tyrion Lannister : I sent for you days ago.

Tyrion Lannister : Doing what?

Tyrion Lannister : Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.

Tyrion Lannister : She's dim-witted.

Tyrion Lannister : When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?

Tyrion Lannister : And you understand the rules of inheritance?

Tyrion Lannister : She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.

Tyrion Lannister : You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?

Tyrion Lannister : Is it two wives you want or two castles?

Tyrion Lannister : I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.

Tyrion Lannister : You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.

Tyrion Lannister : My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it.

Tyrion Lannister : Does he frighten you so much?

Tyrion Lannister : Because you're my friend.

Tyrion Lannister : I understand.

Tyrion Lannister : Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, we did.

Tyrion Lannister : I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?

Tyrion Lannister : I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.

Tyrion Lannister : Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh.

Tyrion Lannister : Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.

Tyrion Lannister : She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.

Tyrion Lannister : I think I would have remembered that.

Tyrion Lannister : You and my family have more in common than you might admit.

Tyrion Lannister : That would have made things so much easier.

Tyrion Lannister : Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.

Tyrion Lannister : If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.

Jon Snow : You couldn't have known.

Jon Snow : We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want.

Jon Snow : If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close.

Tyrion Lannister : Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?

Tyrion Lannister : Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die.

Tyrion Lannister : That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?

Tyrion Lannister : Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.

Tyrion Lannister : Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?

Tyrion Lannister : Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.

Tyrion Lannister : Nothing made him happier.

Tyrion Lannister : On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.

Tyrion Lannister : For you. You drifted away.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson.

Tyrion Lannister : I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. "Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?" He gave me an answer. "Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library.

Tyrion Lannister : Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of "khuu, khuu, khuu". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard "khuu, khuu, khuu" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.

Tyrion Lannister : I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once.

Tyrion Lannister : He just pushed me aside with a "khuu" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?

Tyrion Lannister : Looks like very light armor.

Tyrion Lannister : You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.

Tyrion Lannister : It could get you killed. It could get me killed.

Tyrion Lannister : Thank the gods.

Jon Snow : She...she had red hair.

Jon Snow : Well what do you want me to say?

Jon Snow : So you and Gilly never-

Jon Snow : But if she had, you wouldo ve? You'd have broken your vows?

Jon Snow : What?

Jon Snow : I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.

Jon Snow : It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!

Jon Snow : And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.

Jon Snow : There will.

Jon Snow : Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch.

Jon Snow : There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser.

Jon Snow : Yes sir.

Jon Snow : It was a difficult decision either way, Ser.

Jon Snow : We can't just let them attack the gate!

Jon Snow : Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?

Jon Snow : Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!

Jon Snow : They won't summit before dawn.

Jon Snow : Because I've made that claim.

Jon Snow : Knock! Draw! Loose!

Jon Snow : Now!

Jon Snow : to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate.

Jon Snow : grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...

Jon Snow : Oil!

Jon Snow : What are you doing up here?

Jon Snow : Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them.

Jon Snow : Two brothers now fight with me.

Jon Snow : to Sam* I don't want you out there.

Jon Snow : I need him more than I need you.

Jon Snow : No, shh, don't talk.

Jon Snow : We'll go back there.

Jon Snow : Tormund. It's over, let it end.

Jon Snow : Put him in chains. We'll question him later.

Jon Snow : Aye, you shouldo ve.

Jon Snow : For one night.

Jon Snow : Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them.

Jon Snow : I'm going to find Mance.

Jon Snow : Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home.

Jon Snow : I'm going to try.

Jon Snow : He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.

Jon Snow : You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?

Jon Snow : They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out.

Jon Snow : I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.

Jon Snow : I've been sent to negotiate with you.

Jon Snow : The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows.

Jon Snow : She put three arrows in me when I escaped.

Jon Snow : Yes.

Jon Snow : She's dead.

Jon Snow : No.

Jon Snow : Ygritte.

Jon Snow : That's not wine.

Jon Snow : He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.

Jon Snow : Grenn came from a farm.

Jon Snow : Grenn and Mag.

Jon Snow : Turn your army around and go home.

Jon Snow : I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.

Jon Snow : No, it's like you said, we don't have the men.

Jon Snow : I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.

Jon Snow : I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son.

Jon Snow : He was, your grace.

Jon Snow : I was this man's prisoner once. He couldo ve tortured me, he couldo ve killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father wouldo ve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say.

Jon Snow : Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them.

Jon Snow : He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe.

Jon Snow : No one's going to torture you.

Jon Snow : I don't know what happens to the prisoners.

Jon Snow : I suppose Stannis does.

Jon Snow : I don't have a king.

Jon Snow : We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?

Jon Snow : Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.

Jon Snow : Say farewell.

Jon Snow : She told you?

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, get on with it you son of a whore.

Tyrion Lannister : What're you doing?

Tyrion Lannister : Who's helping you?

Tyrion Lannister : Varys?

Tyrion Lannister : I suppose this is goodbye, then.

Tyrion Lannister : Jaime, thank you. For my life.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Tyrion Lannister : All my life, you've wanted me dead.

Tyrion Lannister : I loved her.

Tyrion Lannister : Shae.

Tyrion Lannister : I murdered her. With my own hands.

Tyrion Lannister : It doesn't matter?

Tyrion Lannister : Say that word again.

Tyrion Lannister : I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn't poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?

Tyrion Lannister : I can't go back there. She's in there.

Tyrion Lannister : I am your son. I have always been your son.

Tyrion Lannister : I still don't see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?

Tyrion Lannister : Pentos?

Tyrion Lannister : Much better.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.

Tyrion Lannister : In a box. Why stop now?

Tyrion Lannister : The future is shit. Just like the past.

Jon Snow : Get your shield up.

Jon Snow : If it wasn't heavy it wouldn't stop a sword, now get it up.

Jon Snow : Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I'll ring your head like a bell.

Jon Snow : Good, good, pivot! Don't forget to pivot! Shield up!

Jon Snow : You're not cold, my lady?

Jon Snow : No.

Jon Snow : Roose Bolton.

Jon Snow : I want a great many things, your grace. But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now.

Jon Snow : They're good men.

Jon Snow : It's where she belonged.

Jon Snow : They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn't make them monsters.

Jon Snow : The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part--

Jon Snow : Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?

Jon Snow : I don't think that's likely.

Jon Snow : I respect him.

Jon Snow : Your grace.

Jon Snow : How much time do I have?

Tyrion Lannister : Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers.

Tyrion Lannister : Not for a coward.

Tyrion Lannister : You never told me why you set me free.

Tyrion Lannister : You could have said no.

Tyrion Lannister : Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You're not family, you owe me nothing.

Tyrion Lannister : A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.

Tyrion Lannister : You're going to have to find another soldier. I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not well-suited for work.

Tyrion Lannister : Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.

Tyrion Lannister : What is it you want exactly?

Tyrion Lannister : Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that's how they became powerful in the first place.

Tyrion Lannister : I will never sit on the Iron Throne.

Tyrion Lannister : Good luck finding him.

Tyrion Lannister : Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?

Jon Snow : Here we are.

Jon Snow : This doesn't have to be our last meeting.

Jon Snow : You know what Stannis wants?

Jon Snow : Shouldn't a king be bold?

Jon Snow : You told me you weren't here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.

Jon Snow : You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?

Jon Snow : Then bend the knee and save your people.

Jon Snow : And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid.

Jon Snow : They'll burn you alive.

Jon Snow : And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. "You'd rather burn than kneel. The great hero."� Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there's no one left to sing.

Jon Snow : I think you're making a terrible mistake.

Tyrion Lannister : There's a bug.

Tyrion Lannister : When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?

Tyrion Lannister : I want to take a walk.

Tyrion Lannister : She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere.

Tyrion Lannister : You're right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?

Tyrion Lannister : And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?

Tyrion Lannister : We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.

Tyrion Lannister : I didn't rule. I was a servant.

Tyrion Lannister : Managed to kill a lot of people.

Tyrion Lannister : She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.

Tyrion Lannister : Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.

Tyrion Lannister : I find us repulsive.

Tyrion Lannister : You're right. Let's go for a walk.

Tyrion Lannister : How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?

Jon Snow : With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive.

Jon Snow : No. Only one of their own.

Jon Snow : The Lord Commander's niece.

Jon Snow : Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark.

Jon Snow : I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own.

Jon Snow : Most likely.

Jon Snow : Unpleasant, I expect.

Jon Snow : I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you.

Jon Snow : I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow.

Jon Snow : It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again.

Jon Snow : I'm going to refuse him.

Jon Snow : I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?

Jon Snow : Your Grace.

Jon Snow : Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command.

Jon Snow : I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.

Jon Snow : But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.

Jon Snow : I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

Jon Snow : I can imagine no higher praise.

Jon Snow : May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?

Jon Snow : You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.

Jon Snow : And the wildlings?

Jon Snow : Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. .

Jon Snow : I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.

Jon Snow : I'm sorry I disappointed him.

Jon Snow : As long as he's ruling them.

Jon Snow : I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.

Jon Snow : And what needs to be done?

Jon Snow : Sam. . Maester Aemon?

Jon Snow : Take good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger.

Jon Snow : Ser Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger.

Jon Snow : Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.

Jon Snow : Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -

Jon Snow : You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard.

Jon Snow : Are you refusing to obey my order?

Jon Snow : Take Lord Janos outside.

Jon Snow : Olly, bring me my sword.

Jon Snow : If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time.

Tyrion Lannister : I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

Tyrion Lannister : Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

Tyrion Lannister : I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm losing my mind.

Tyrion Lannister : Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. . What am I? . One more drunk dwarf.

Tyrion Lannister : Slaves.

Tyrion Lannister : The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.

Tyrion Lannister : Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. .

Tyrion Lannister : We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?

Tyrion Lannister : Come on. Let's find a brothel.

Tyrion Lannister : It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.

Tyrion Lannister : See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust.

Tyrion Lannister : Curious... hair. .

Tyrion Lannister : It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, , she's taken.

Tyrion Lannister : I need to speak to someone with hair.

Tyrion Lannister : Hello?

Tyrion Lannister : You've got no drink.

Tyrion Lannister : Do I look like a man without money? . Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. . But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? . I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it.

Tyrion Lannister : That's because they've never met a queen.

Tyrion Lannister : You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you.

Tyrion Lannister : Because you have a skeptical mind.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm, I'm sorry, I can't.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not.

Tyrion Lannister : Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I'll go for a piss, that's a start.

Tyrion Lannister : No need to worry, I was just - . Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige.

Tyrion Lannister : You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and -

Jon Snow : Good.

Jon Snow : Never even heard of these people.

Jon Snow : And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?

Jon Snow : Not him.

Jon Snow : He murdered my brother.

Jon Snow : How can I help you?

Jon Snow : Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.

Jon Snow : You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions.

Jon Snow : I don't think Stannis would like that very much.

Jon Snow : I can't.

Jon Snow : I swore a vow. . I loved another.

Jon Snow : I know. But I still love her.

Tyrion Lannister : Thank you. . Who are you?

Tyrion Lannister : Do you have wine?

Tyrion Lannister : I can't sleep without wine.

Tyrion Lannister : You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.

Tyrion Lannister : You said you were taking me to the Queen.

Tyrion Lannister : What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!

Tyrion Lannister : Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? . A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. . And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely.

Jon Snow : Maester Aemon.

Jon Snow : Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.

Jon Snow : How are you feeling?

Jon Snow : I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.

Jon Snow : But you don't know what it is.

Jon Snow : Where are the rest of the free folk now? . Where have they gone? . Who leads them?

Jon Snow : What about you?

Jon Snow : What if I unchained you?

Jon Snow : Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.

Jon Snow : For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you.

Jon Snow : It is.

Jon Snow : Because now, , I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

Jon Snow : I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.

Jon Snow : I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.

Jon Snow : And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward.

Jon Snow : Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.

Jon Snow : Up on Storroldo s Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.

Jon Snow : I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.

Jon Snow : Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing.

Jon Snow : And we've slaughtered theirs.

Jon Snow : You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that.

Jon Snow : Thank you. . Olly. . If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right.

Jon Snow : It's not a trick.

Jon Snow : I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.

Jon Snow : No.

Jon Snow : You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you.

Tyrion Lannister : Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. . Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.

Tyrion Lannister : What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.

Tyrion Lannister : I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not.

Tyrion Lannister : I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.

Tyrion Lannister : Have you sailed this route before?

Tyrion Lannister : You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?

Tyrion Lannister : You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?

Tyrion Lannister : Oh.

Tyrion Lannister : The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -

Tyrion Lannister : And then they weren't. "They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned "-

Tyrion Lannister : I would clap.

Tyrion Lannister : I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains.

Tyrion Lannister : What was that?

Tyrion Lannister : Mormont, cut me free! . Mormont!

Tyrion Lannister : Mormont! Mormont!

Tyrion Lannister : You? . I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that.

Tyrion Lannister : It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. . Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. . So what now?

Tyrion Lannister : Without luck?

Tyrion Lannister : That's the best idea you've had all day.

Tyrion Lannister : So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can't live on berries and roots.

Tyrion Lannister : You're not hungry?

Tyrion Lannister : You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met.

Tyrion Lannister : We are travelling together. In each other's company. Therefore.

Tyrion Lannister : I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.

Tyrion Lannister : Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.

Tyrion Lannister : I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.

Tyrion Lannister : As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man.

Tyrion Lannister : I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? "We shall never see his like again."�

Tyrion Lannister : You didn't know. I'm sorry. I am.

Tyrion Lannister : I only know what I heard

Tyrion Lannister : He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.

Tyrion Lannister : Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion.

Tyrion Lannister : I believe in many things.

Tyrion Lannister : No.

Tyrion Lannister : Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.

Tyrion Lannister : The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?

Tyrion Lannister : We? Alright, let's assume your dreams come true. She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?

Tyrion Lannister : So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?

Tyrion Lannister : Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?

Tyrion Lannister : Why is it anchored?

Tyrion Lannister : Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let's discuss this!

Tyrion Lannister : Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?

Tyrion Lannister : Guess again.

Tyrion Lannister : The fighting puts in Mereen! You're in luck then, you're about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms.

Tyrion Lannister : Him.

Tyrion Lannister : Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!

Tyrion Lannister : He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.

Tyrion Lannister : The Kingslayer!

Jon Snow : First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black.

Jon Snow : As always, thank you for your honesty.

Jon Snow : Thank you, Sam.

Jon Snow : Me too.

Tyrion Lannister : Wait! You have to buy me as well.

Tyrion Lannister : We're a team. I'm a great fighter, too.

Tyrion Lannister : Thank you my Lord. Thank you.

Tyrion Lannister : My Lord, if I may. I've heard Mereen's become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage.

Tyrion Lannister : What are you doing?

Tyrion Lannister : It's true. He has.

Tyrion Lannister : I am the gift. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister : If only I were otherwise.

Tyrion Lannister : You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.

Tyrion Lannister : Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.

Tyrion Lannister : When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.

Tyrion Lannister : Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.

Tyrion Lannister : Killing and politics aren't always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.

Tyrion Lannister : I know.

Tyrion Lannister : Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you.

Tyrion Lannister : Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?

Tyrion Lannister : And did he?

Tyrion Lannister : He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him.

Tyrion Lannister : A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do.

Tyrion Lannister : Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?

Tyrion Lannister : I can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done.

Tyrion Lannister : My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.

Tyrion Lannister : Some day if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this.

Tyrion Lannister : So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers.

Tyrion Lannister : I've heard stories.

Tyrion Lannister : To see if you were the right kind of terrible.

Tyrion Lannister : The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.

Tyrion Lannister : He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother.

Tyrion Lannister : That's the one.

Tyrion Lannister : Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting.

Tyrion Lannister : No? Banish me?

Tyrion Lannister : So if I'm not going to be murdered, and I'm not going to be banished...

Tyrion Lannister : Advise you on what?

Tyrion Lannister : The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.

Tyrion Lannister : And when you get back to your home, who supports you?

Tyrion Lannister : Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough.

Tyrion Lannister : It's a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You're not the first person to have dreamt it.

Jon Snow : Does that make me a fool?

Jon Snow : He's not my prisoner.

Jon Snow : We're allies.

Jon Snow : We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.

Jon Snow : My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there.

Jon Snow : In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.

Jon Snow : It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.

Jon Snow : Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.

Jon Snow : No. But I trust the man.

Jon Snow : Come with me and I'll share these weapons.

Jon Snow : There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.

Jon Snow : I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life.

Jon Snow : If you swear you join us when the real war begins.

Jon Snow : He died.

Jon Snow : I put an arrow through his heart.

Jon Snow : I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight.

Jon Snow : How many are with us? 5000?

Jon Snow : We're leaving too many behind.

Jon Snow : And he knew them better than I ever will.

Jon Snow : Get in line! Get in line!

Jon Snow : Hold the line! Hold the line!

Jon Snow : Get them to the ship and come back for me!

Jon Snow : Now!

Jon Snow : You should be on one of those boats.

Jon Snow : You have my word. I've given orders.

Jon Snow : Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!

Jon Snow : The Dragonglass!

Jon Snow : Go! Go! Go!

Jon Snow : Let's go now! Now!

Jon Snow : It was a failure.

Jon Snow : I went to save them, I failed.

Jon Snow : I don't think that fact's lost on them.

Jon Snow : Here's a silver because the lady likes you.

Tyrion Lannister : The smaller man it is.

Tyrion Lannister : There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.

Tyrion Lannister : It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.

Tyrion Lannister : My father would have liked you.

Tyrion Lannister : Well said, you're an eloquent man. Doesn't mean you're wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles.

Tyrion Lannister : You can end this.

Tyrion Lannister : You can!

Tyrion Lannister : Stay close!

Jon Snow : He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world.

Jon Snow : I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the wall.

Jon Snow : No one's ever getting that back, now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it.

Jon Snow : With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw.

Jon Snow : Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?

Jon Snow : Here's to us then. Long may they sneer.

Jon Snow : What?

Jon Snow : I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?

Jon Snow : You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too.

Jon Snow : Sam?

Jon Snow : Sam.

Jon Snow : You've just been beaten half to death. How did you--

Jon Snow : I'm glad the end of the worldo s working out for someone.

Jon Snow : To your return.

Tyrion Lannister : You love her, don't you? How could you not. Of course, it's hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman.

Tyrion Lannister : Dwarf. I believe that's the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit "nostril"�.

Tyrion Lannister : Rusty"� Thank you.

Tyrion Lannister : He's right. The dragon headed north. If we're going to find her, that's where we're to go.

Tyrion Lannister : And I intend to help her do it.

Tyrion Lannister : You betrayed her!

Tyrion Lannister : And she exiled you, twice, I believe?

Tyrion Lannister : Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.

Tyrion Lannister : Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.

Tyrion Lannister : Pardon me?

Tyrion Lannister : Not precisely, but I have other skills that'd be very useful--

Tyrion Lannister : I have fought. I don't claim to be a great warrior.

Tyrion Lannister : Middling.

Tyrion Lannister : And drink. I've survived so far.

Tyrion Lannister : I suppose there's no point in asking how you found me.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, she didn't execute me, so that's a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I'm stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?

Tyrion Lannister : If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.

Tyrion Lannister : I did miss you.

Jon Snow : We don't have enough men to make any difference.

Jon Snow : The wildlings won't ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--

Jon Snow : It's not their fight!

Jon Snow : Stannis?

Jon Snow : Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?

Jon Snow : He could be lying.

Jon Snow : Where is he?

Jon Snow : Olly.

Tyrion Lannister : We're never going to fix what's wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid

Tyrion Lannister : We'll be fine We're dressed like common merchants

Tyrion Lannister : You've spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?

Tyrion Lannister : It's a good thing you're not a boy anymore...because you have no cock

Tyrion Lannister : For your baby To eat

Tyrion Lannister : I know what mhysa means

Tyrion Lannister : Hard to know Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be

Tyrion Lannister : Very possibly Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren't even property to begin with You can see why they're unhappy Of course, it could also be the freed men

Tyrion Lannister : Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them

Tyrion Lannister : It's a problem

Tyrion Lannister : Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you We can't fight an enemy we don't know

Tyrion Lannister : And have you started looking for that someone?

Tyrion Lannister : Well, we won't be sailing to Westeros anytime soon

Tyrion Lannister : If I lost my cock, I'd drink all the time

Tyrion Lannister : Meaning no offense He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes

Tyrion Lannister : You think them

Tyrion Lannister : Surely there's some good news lurking somewhere

Tyrion Lannister : Perhaps they can tell us their secret

Tyrion Lannister : What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid

Tyrion Lannister : Daenerys is the dragon queen Can't very well let the dragons starve, that's obvious

Tyrion Lannister : Dragons do not do well in captivity

Tyrion Lannister : That's what I do I drink and I know things

Tyrion Lannister : The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles Then Daenerys's ancestors started chaining them up in pens A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats They must be unchained or they'll waste away Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons?

Tyrion Lannister : And did they ever harm you?

Tyrion Lannister : Dragons are intelligent More intelligent than men according to some maesters They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies I am their friend

Tyrion Lannister : They will It's time they had their supper

Tyrion Lannister : I'm friends with your mother I'm here to help Don't eat the help

Tyrion Lannister : When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day I begged him for one of you "It wouldn't even have to be a big dragon,"� I told him "It could be little, like me"�

Tyrion Lannister : Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago I cried myself to sleep that night

Tyrion Lannister : But here you are

Tyrion Lannister : Next time I have an idea like that, punch me in the face

Jon Snow : They stabbed me Olly...he put a knife in my heart I shouldn't be here

Jon Snow : Nothing There was nothing at all

Jon Snow : I did what I thought was right And I got murdered for it And now I'm back Why?

Jon Snow : I don't know how to do that I thought I did, but...I failed

Jon Snow : I'm not a god

Jon Snow : I think so Hold off on burning my body for now

Eddard Stark : I looked for you on the Trident

Eddard Stark : The Mad King is dead Rhaegar lies beneath the ground Why weren't you there to protect your prince?

Eddard Stark : Where's my sister?

Eddard Stark : No Now it ends

Tyrion Lannister : What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?

Tyrion Lannister : You speak 19 languages You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things

Tyrion Lannister : You two, you spend a great deal of time together What would you be talking about if I weren't here?

Tyrion Lannister : That's good That's very good

Tyrion Lannister : But that's a report I was thinking more of a conversation A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms

Tyrion Lannister : Me Just now All right, no conversations Let's play a game

Tyrion Lannister : You don't play games, either one of you, ever?

Tyrion Lannister : There, that's a start

Tyrion Lannister : Oh no, no, no Not that, of course not that Innocent games, fun games, drinking games

Tyrion Lannister : Until you do

Tyrion Lannister : Alright No drinking We can play without drinking It's a wonderful game I invented it Here's how it works I make a statement about your past If I'm wrong, I drink And if I'm right -- Maybe we can't play without drinking

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, you took your time

Tyrion Lannister : You see? You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it

Tyrion Lannister : If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?

Tyrion Lannister : You may be right

Tyrion Lannister : Possibly

Tyrion Lannister : It's a conversation

Tyrion Lannister : Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis

Jon Snow : If you have any last words, now is the time

Jon Snow : Neither was killing me

Jon Snow : I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser

Jon Snow : You should

Jon Snow : Wear it Burn it Whatever you want You have Castle Black

Jon Snow : My watch is ended

Jon Snow : South

Jon Snow : Get warm

Jon Snow : I did everything I could You know that

Jon Snow : Aye, I pledged my life to the Night's Watch I gave my life

Jon Snow : They killed me, Edd! My own brothers You want me to stay here after that?

Jon Snow : With the peas and onions?

Jon Snow : We never should have left Winterfell

Jon Snow : How could we know?

Jon Snow : We were children

Jon Snow : You were occasionally awful I'm sure I can't have been great fun Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played

Jon Snow : There's nothing to forgive

Jon Snow : All right All right, I forgive you

Jon Snow : You'd think after thousands of years, the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale

Jon Snow : Where will we go? If I don't watch over you, Father's ghost will come back and murder me

Jon Snow : I can't stay here, not after what happened

Jon Snow : Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?

Jon Snow : I don't have an army

Jon Snow : They didn't come here to serve me

Jon Snow : Sansa

Jon Snow : I'm tired of fighting

Jon Snow : It's all I've done since I left home I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch I've killed wildlings I've killed men that I admire I hanged a boy younger than Bran I fought and I lost

Tyrion Lannister : I did As a clever man once told me, "We make peace with our enemies, not our friends"�

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, that's the military approach And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach

Tyrion Lannister : We enter these negotiations with open eyes Trust me My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution

Tyrion Lannister : Long enough to know

Tyrion Lannister : And now you speak for the Good Masters of AstaporHere's to reversals of fortune

Tyrion Lannister : Let's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want

Tyrion Lannister : Queen Daenerys won't stay in Meereen forever Her path takes her westward

Tyrion Lannister : Friends, friends, friends, please

Tyrion Lannister : There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing That is the way of the world I'm not here to change the way of the world

Tyrion Lannister : You don't need slaves to make money There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it So here is the queen's proposal Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver's Bay time to adjust to the new order

Tyrion Lannister : Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice

Tyrion Lannister : Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy

Tyrion Lannister : Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same I do hope you accept, my friends You will not receive a better offer

Tyrion Lannister : Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it And as a parting gift to our honored guests.

Tyrion Lannister : Give freedom a chance See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before

Tyrion Lannister : My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time

Tyrion Lannister : Excellent

Tyrion Lannister : I did

Tyrion Lannister : I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled

Tyrion Lannister : But I am not your ruler I'm not the Breaker of Chains I'm not the Unburnt And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons

Tyrion Lannister : Because our queen chose me as her advisor Until she returns from her travels --

Tyrion Lannister : Soon You have my word

Tyrion Lannister : And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace

Tyrion Lannister : We offered terms

Tyrion Lannister : Those men respect you

Tyrion Lannister : As do I

Tyrion Lannister : I am not betraying her work I am trying to save her city

Tyrion Lannister : For a short time

Tyrion Lannister : You're right Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once War is a horror that should be ended at once I can't do both today

Tyrion Lannister : I don't trust the Masters I trust their self-interest They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest

Tyrion Lannister : They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast Their contempt is their weakness They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage

Jon Snow : I'm not Lord Commander anymore.

Jon Snow : SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading.

Jon Snow : To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.

Jon Snow : SNOW looks at SANSA.

Jon Snow : His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You --

Jon Snow : It's just more of the same.

Jon Snow : SNOW puts the letter away, but SANSA takes it and continues reading.

Jon Snow : Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.

Jon Snow : We don't know that.

Jon Snow : How many do you have?

Jon Snow : SNOW nods.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not enough.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced.

Tyrion Lannister : Who said anything about "him"�?

Tyrion Lannister : Welcome to Meereen.

Tyrion Lannister : That's about the extent of my Valyrian.

Tyrion Lannister : Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.

Tyrion Lannister : The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --

Tyrion Lannister : Yes.

Tyrion Lannister : She did indeed.

Tyrion Lannister : Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.

Tyrion Lannister : I'd settle for obeyed.

Tyrion Lannister : That sounds most excellent --

Tyrion Lannister : We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.

Tyrion Lannister : My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.

Jon Snow : We can't defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men.

Jon Snow : There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build.

Jon Snow : How do you know that?

Jon Snow : New dress?

Jon Snow : Year, it's -- I like the wolf bit.

Jon Snow : Thank you, Sansa.

Jon Snow : Don't knock it down while I'm gone.

Jon Snow : That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive.

Jon Snow : Are you sure they'll come?

Jon Snow : Lady Mormont.

Jon Snow : I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -

Jon Snow : Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -

Jon Snow : Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance.

Jon Snow : Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -

Jon Snow : Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.

Jon Snow : Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?

Jon Snow : 62?

Jon Snow : Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out.

Jon Snow : The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -

Jon Snow : House Mormont.

Jon Snow : We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -

Jon Snow : The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.

Jon Snow : Lord Glover.

Jon Snow : We're not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..

Jon Snow : We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.

Jon Snow : Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.

Jon Snow : There's no time.

Jon Snow : We fight with the army we have.

Tyrion Lannister : I'd call that a successful gambit.

Tyrion Lannister : Look around. The city has come back to life.

Tyrion Lannister : I did and it worked.

Tyrion Lannister : Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm going to miss you.

Tyrion Lannister : I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.

Tyrion Lannister : Most of all, we need our queen.

Tyrion Lannister : Varys.

Tyrion Lannister : The most famous dwarf in the world.

Tyrion Lannister : I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself.

Tyrion Lannister : Now it's like a man reborn.

Tyrion Lannister : Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?

Tyrion Lannister : Why not?

Tyrion Lannister : And who made these rules? Your former masters?

Tyrion Lannister : Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human. Have a drink with me.

Tyrion Lannister : And you? What's your excuse?

Tyrion Lannister : That's how you know it's working.

Tyrion Lannister : Here's to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.

Tyrion Lannister : To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you like it?

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I'd like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp's Delight. Only my close friends could drink it.

Tyrion Lannister : Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.

Tyrion Lannister : Grey worm?

Tyrion Lannister : Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale...

Tyrion Lannister : but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, "Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out."�

Tyrion Lannister : It's funnier in Westeros.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes.

Tyrion Lannister : A story that's supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps.

Tyrion Lannister : Missandei, do you like the wine?

Tyrion Lannister : Tell a joke.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah!

Tyrion Lannister : You lied to us.

Tyrion Lannister : I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -

Tyrion Lannister : I was wrong. I admit it.

Tyrion Lannister : The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers' forces- -

Tyrion Lannister : And I have acknowledged that. I'm trying- -

Tyrion Lannister : All right, what should the army do?

Tyrion Lannister : And then?

Tyrion Lannister : Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise.

Tyrion Lannister : Perhaps we should take shelter.

Tyrion Lannister : Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters.

Tyrion Lannister : it proves that no one needs a Master.

Tyrion Lannister : Do we have a plan?

Tyrion Lannister : You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?

Tyrion Lannister : Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That's why Jaime killed him.

Tyrion Lannister : You're talking about destroying cities. It's not entirely different. I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.

Tyrion Lannister : We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.

Tyrion Lannister : Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.

Tyrion Lannister : It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it, other people dying?

Tyrion Lannister : Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.

Jon Snow : You don't have to be here.

Jon Snow : You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me.

Jon Snow : Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?

Jon Snow : If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.

Jon Snow : It's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning...

Jon Snow : We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment.

Jon Snow : A pincer move.

Jon Snow : They won't be able to hit us from the sides.

Jon Snow : No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.

Jon Snow : Aye, for what they're worth.

Jon Snow : You're right.

Jon Snow : He's overconfident.

Jon Snow : Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

Jon Snow : All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?

Jon Snow : We can't give up on our brother.

Jon Snow : Of course he does. What should I do differently?

Jon Snow : Aye, that's good advice.

Jon Snow : Well, it is a bit obvious.

Jon Snow : When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men!

Jon Snow : Now, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds.

Jon Snow : SNOW I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise.

Jon Snow : My lady. You weren't at the war council.

Jon Snow : Any advice?

Jon Snow : If I do, if I fall, don't bring me back.

Jon Snow : I'm ordering you not to bring me back.

Jon Snow : You're in my camp. I'm the commander.

Jon Snow : How do you know what he commands?

Jon Snow : Why?

Jon Snow : What kind of god would do something like that?

Tyrion Lannister : Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. "The height of nobility,"� "a man of your stature,"� "someone to look up to."� You're all making the same five or six jokes.

Tyrion Lannister : It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.

Tyrion Lannister : Doesn't seem like it. He's still alive. It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?

Tyrion Lannister : We can agree upon that at least.

Tyrion Lannister : With the former Masters' fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.

Tyrion Lannister : The Seven Kingdoms.

Tyrion Lannister : What if everyone starts demanding their independence?

Jon Snow : Get word --

Jon Snow : We're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.

Jon Snow : When we had feasts, our family would sit up here. and I'd sit down there.

Jon Snow : Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most.

Jon Snow : What is that?

Jon Snow : Do you have anything to say for yourself?

Jon Snow : Ride south today. If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer.

Jon Snow : I'm having the lordo s chamber prepared for you.

Jon Snow : I'm not a Stark.

Jon Snow : You're the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We're standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.

Jon Snow : And you trust him?

Jon Snow : We need to trust each other. We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.

Jon Snow : Well, Father always promised, didn't he?

Tyrion Lannister : How did he take it?

Tyrion Lannister : I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That's the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it's any consolation.

Tyrion Lannister : No, I suppose not. I'm terrible at consoling.

Tyrion Lannister : All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It's all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?

Tyrion Lannister : Good. You're in the great game now. And the great game's terrifying. The only people who aren't afraid of failure are madmen like your father.

Tyrion Lannister : He wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last.

Tyrion Lannister : For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone's always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am.

Tyrion Lannister : I believe in you. It's embarrassing, really. I'd swear you my sword, but I don't actually own a sword.

Tyrion Lannister : It's yours. Now and always.

Eddard Stark : Lyanna.

Eddard Stark : No, I'm not a dream. I'm here. Right here.

Eddard Stark : I've missed you, too.

Eddard Stark : Shh. You are.

Eddard Stark : You're not going to die.

Eddard Stark : Get her some water!

Eddard Stark : Is there a maester?

Jon Snow : The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield.

Jon Snow : The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won't wait out the storm. He brings the storm.

Jon Snow : There's nothing to forgive, my lord.

Jon Snow : I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow.

Jon Snow : Not just the boys.

Jon Snow : We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.

Jon Snow : While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk.

Jon Snow : But if we're going to survive this winter together...

Jon Snow : Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

Jon Snow : If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold.

Jon Snow : The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.

Jon Snow : I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.

Jon Snow : The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.

Jon Snow : When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, "The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword," and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final.

Jon Snow : Ned Umber.

Jon Snow : Alys Karstark.

Jon Snow : For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon.

Jon Snow : Stand.

Jon Snow : Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?

Jon Snow : You are my sister, but I am king now.

Jon Snow : When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me.

Jon Snow : Of course you can, but--

Jon Snow : Do you think I'm Joffrey?

Jon Snow : Thank you.

Jon Snow : At what?

Jon Snow : No.

Jon Snow : What did father used to say? Everything before the word "but" is horse shit.

Jon Snow : No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls.

Jon Snow : All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me.

Jon Snow : And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?

Jon Snow : Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--

Jon Snow : Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.

Jon Snow : I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too.

Jon Snow : There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.

Jon Snow : You almost sound as if you admire her.

Tyrion Lannister : On a night like this, you came into the world.

Tyrion Lannister : We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.

Tyrion Lannister : Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.

Tyrion Lannister : We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--

Tyrion Lannister : Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.

Tyrion Lannister : Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?

Tyrion Lannister : Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?

Tyrion Lannister : I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.

Tyrion Lannister : I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character.

Tyrion Lannister : If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.

Jon Snow : Read the last bit.

Jon Snow : It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?

Jon Snow : What?

Jon Snow : But?

Tyrion Lannister : If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.

Tyrion Lannister : I know how you wage war. We don't poison little girls here. Myrcella was innocent.

Tyrion Lannister : But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.

Tyrion Lannister : Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country. If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point. Our army should be Westerosi.

Tyrion Lannister : You are.

Tyrion Lannister : Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.

Tyrion Lannister : The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army. Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.

Tyrion Lannister : The unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.

Jon Snow : Come in.

Jon Snow : This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.

Jon Snow : I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.

Jon Snow : He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons.

Jon Snow : Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.

Jon Snow : We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.

Jon Snow : But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone.

Jon Snow : I know that.

Jon Snow : It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man.

Jon Snow : You all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it.

Jon Snow : Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me.

Jon Snow : I'm leaving both in good hands.

Jon Snow : Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours.

Jon Snow : You don't belong down here.

Jon Snow : I have nothing to say to you.

Jon Snow : Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.

Tyrion Lannister : The bastard of Winterfell.

Jon Snow : The dwarf of Casterly Rock.

Tyrion Lannister : I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.

Jon Snow : You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road.

Tyrion Lannister : It's been a long road. But we're both still here.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm Tyrion Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister : and DAVOS shake hands.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

Tyrion Lannister : Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.

Jon Snow : Of course.

Tyrion Lannister : And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well.

Jon Snow : She is.

Tyrion Lannister : Does she miss me terribly?

Tyrion Lannister : A sham marriage and unconsummated.

Jon Snow : I didn't ask --

Tyrion Lannister : Well, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on.

Jon Snow : She's starting to let on.

Tyrion Lannister : Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.

Jon Snow : As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.

Tyrion Lannister : A long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it.

Jon Snow : My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south.

Jon Snow : True. But I'm not a Stark.

Tyrion Lannister : I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do.

Tyrion Lannister : Come. Their mother is waiting for you.

Jon Snow : The winds were kind, Your Grace.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.

Tyrion Lannister : Forever.

Jon Snow : I am not.

Jon Snow : Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.

Jon Snow : You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.

Jon Snow : Because I need your help and you need mine.

Jon Snow : I did.

Jon Snow : They're hard to miss.

Tyrion Lannister : Almost.

Jon Snow : But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.

Jon Snow : Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair.

Tyrion Lannister : I do.

Tyrion Lannister : I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.

Jon Snow : Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north.

Jon Snow : I am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy.

Jon Snow : The Army of the Dead is on the march.

Tyrion Lannister : The Army of the Dead?

Jon Snow : You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?

Tyrion Lannister : No, I don't think you're either of those things.

Jon Snow : The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --

Jon Snow : we're finished.

Jon Snow : You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.

Tyrion Lannister : The war against my sister has already begun. You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --

Tyrion Lannister : whatever you saw beyond the wall.

Tyrion Lannister : If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.

Tyrion Lannister : Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys. Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.

Jon Snow : There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --

Tyrion Lannister : It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.

Jon Snow : And why would I do that?

Jon Snow : I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can.

Jon Snow : Am I your prisoner?

Tyrion Lannister : I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.

Jon Snow : I'm a prisoner on this island.

Tyrion Lannister : I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want.

Jon Snow : Except to my ship. They took my ship.

Tyrion Lannister : I wouldn't say we took your ship.

Jon Snow : I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.

Tyrion Lannister : Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.

Jon Snow : It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --

Jon Snow : You probably don't believe me.

Tyrion Lannister : I do actually.

Jon Snow : You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.

Tyrion Lannister : It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.

Jon Snow : How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?

Tyrion Lannister : Good question.

Jon Snow : I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.

Tyrion Lannister : People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister.

Jon Snow : I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.

Tyrion Lannister : It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.

Jon Snow : Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool.

Tyrion Lannister : Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask.

Tyrion Lannister : So do you have anything reasonable to ask?

Jon Snow : What do you mean?

Tyrion Lannister : Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.

Tyrion Lannister : Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.

Tyrion Lannister : Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature.

Tyrion Lannister : I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't remember.

Tyrion Lannister : I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock.

Tyrion Lannister : You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.

Jon Snow : Amazing thing to see.

Jon Snow : You've been talking to Tyrion?

Jon Snow : He enjoys talking.

Jon Snow : I don't.

Jon Snow : I never expected that you would.

Jon Snow : I haven't either.

Jon Snow : Thank you.

Jon Snow : So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?

Tyrion Lannister : But you'll have to go yourself. Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place. You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.

Tyrion Lannister : It's too great a risk. You're too important.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready.

Tyrion Lannister : No one has ever taken the rock.

Tyrion Lannister : The Lannister army is still the army my father built. Well trained and well provisioned. 10,000 men at least. They will see us coming.

Tyrion Lannister : They will be ready.

Tyrion Lannister : The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.

Tyrion Lannister : The fight up the walls will be hard. We'll be at a disadvantage. Many men will die.

Tyrion Lannister : Interesting thing about my father. He built our house up from near ruin. He built our army. He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers. That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren't welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn't walk them through the front gates. I couldn't have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself.

Tyrion Lannister : It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.

Tyrion Lannister : No better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress.

Tyrion Lannister : As a good friend of mine once said, "give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."

Tyrion Lannister : And so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.

Tyrion Lannister : But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater. They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them. They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triump.

Jon Snow : Your Grace.

Jon Snow : I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.

Jon Snow : leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave. He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls. He continues walking deeper into the cave.

Jon Snow : So this is it, all we'll ever need.

Jon Snow : There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace.

Jon Snow : and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.

Jon Snow : The Children of the Forest made these.

Jon Snow : A very long time ago.

Jon Snow : No.

Jon Snow : They were here together the Children and the First Men.

Jon Snow : takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.

Jon Snow : and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.

Jon Snow : Because the enemy is real. It's always been real.

Jon Snow : No, I don't think I can.

Jon Snow : My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered.

Jon Snow : and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion.

Tyrion Lannister : We took Casterly Rock.

Tyrion Lannister : and VARYS look at each other. They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.

Tyrion Lannister : We still have the largest army.

Tyrion Lannister : Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan.

Tyrion Lannister : If I've underestimated our enemies --

Tyrion Lannister : We've discussed this.

Tyrion Lannister : A smart one.

Jon Snow : I would never presume to --

Jon Snow : looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.

Jon Snow : I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.

Jon Snow : glances back towards the dragons.

Jon Snow : But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same.

Jon Snow : and DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion.

Jon Snow : Who?

Jon Snow : I think she has a good heart.

Jon Snow : There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?

Jon Snow : What?

Jon Snow : It doesn't matter.

Jon Snow : Of course.

Jon Snow : I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married.

Jon Snow : Why did you leave your homeland?

Jon Snow : I'm sorry.

Jon Snow : And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --

Jon Snow : You believe that?

Jon Snow : notices a single ship sailing into the bay. It has a kraken sigil. MISSANDEI turns to look.

Jon Snow : Is that a Greyjoy ship?

Jon Snow : grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face.

Jon Snow : What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.

Jon Snow : releases THEON.

Jon Snow : The queen is gone.

Tyrion Lannister : walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards. He can see Lannisters being slaughtered. One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak.

Tyrion Lannister : is watching the mayhem. Men are screaming and engulfed in flames. Horses and carriages run wild with no driver. JAIME is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde. Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces. Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire. DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water. JAIME sees her approaching his position.

Tyrion Lannister : Flee, you idiot!

Tyrion Lannister : You fucking idiot.

Tyrion Lannister : is walking over an ash covered ground. There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about. Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies. A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to where DAENERYS and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners. DAENERYS addresses the captured soldiers.

Tyrion Lannister : My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible.

Tyrion Lannister : turns to speak to DAENERYS.

Tyrion Lannister : Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace. Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier. He would be invaluable at the Wall.

Tyrion Lannister : You are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.

Tyrion Lannister : turns to speak to DAENERYS. He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --

Tyrion Lannister : pauses and looks over the DROGON. DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace --

Jon Snow : SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away.

Jon Snow : That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts.

Jon Snow : You weren't gone long.

Jon Snow : And?

Jon Snow : pauses and doesn't say anything.

Jon Snow : No, I'm not.

Jon Snow : Thousands.

Jon Snow : Ser Davos gets carried away.

Jon Snow : doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.

Jon Snow : I served with your father. He was a great man.

Tyrion Lannister : All rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do?
