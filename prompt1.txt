Eddard Stark : We've always known the king would oppose any attempt to undermine our military alliance.

Tyrion Lannister : He wouldn't be a Targaryen without a Targaryen.

Eddard Stark : You would be in a position to convince him.

Tyrion Lannister : So, his campaign against the Starks would probably win him no more than an entire city.

Eddard Stark : Perhaps.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course.

Tyrion Lannister : What is it about Ramsay?

Eddard Stark : He didn't want us to do anything to stop him.

Tyrion Lannister : We did anything to stop him?

Eddard Stark : He wanted me dead.

Tyrion Lannister : Why should I care what he wants? I'm Tigard Stark. I can help you.

Eddard Stark : I can. Please, don't do it.

Tyrion Lannister : Stop it.

Eddard Stark : Our alliances are best defended by our friends.

Tyrion Lannister : I can't.

Eddard Stark : Tell me what you want.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not an alliance. It's an effort to defeat Ser Loras Tyrell. A war.

Eddard Stark : Do you know who ordered that attack?

Tyrion Lannister : I did not.
