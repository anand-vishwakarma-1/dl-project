Waymar Royce : What do you expect? They're savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they're ripping each other to pieces.

Will : I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I've never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.

Waymar Royce : How close did you get?

Will : Close as any man would.

Gared : We should head back to the wall.

Royce : Do the dead frighten you?

Gared : Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won't trouble us no more.

Royce : You don't think he'll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.

Will : Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.

Royce : It's a good thing we're not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter . If I don't catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won't say it again.

Royce : Your dead men seem to have moved camp.

Will : They were here.

Gared : See where they went.

Royce : What is it?

Gared : It's .

Jon Snow : Go on. Father's watching.

Jon Snow : And your mother.

Septa Mordane : Fine work, as always. Well done.

Sansa Stark : Thank you.

Septa Mordane : I love the detail that you've managed to get in this corners. . Quite beautiful . the stitching .

Eddard Stark : And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.

Jon Snow : Don't think too much, Bran.

Robb Stark : Relax your bow arm.

Jonrobb : Quick, Bran, faster!

Cassel : Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They've captured a deserter from the Night's Watch.

Eddard Stark : Get the lads to saddle their horses.

Catelyn Stark : Do you have to?

Eddard Stark : He swore an oath, Cat.

Cassel : The law is law, my lady.

Eddard Stark : Tell Bran he's coming, too.

Catelyn Stark : Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.

Eddard Stark : He won't be a boy forever. And winter is coming.

Robb Stark : Lad, go run back and get the rest.

Will : White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them.

Will : I know I broke my oath. And I know I'm a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I'm no coward. Tell them I'm sorry.

Eddard Stark : nods yes, and WILL is positioned on the tree limb that serves as a block.

Will : Forgive me, lord.

Eddard Stark : In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name .

Jon Snow : Don't look away.

Eddard Stark : King of the Andals and the First Men .

Jon Snow : Father will know if you do.

Eddard Stark : Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.

Jon Snow : You did well.

Eddard Stark : You understand why I did it?

Bran Stark : Jon said he was a deserter.

Eddard Stark : But do you understand why I had to kill him?

Bran Stark : Our way is the old way?

Eddard Stark : The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.

Bran Stark : Is it true he saw the White Walkers?

Eddard Stark : The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.

Bran Stark : So he was lying?

Eddard Stark : A madman sees what he sees.

Jon Snow : What is it?

Theon Greyjoy : Mountain lion?

Eddard Stark : There are no mountain lions in these woods.

Theon Greyjoy : It's a freak.

Eddard Stark : It's a direwolf.

Eddard Stark : Tough old beast.

Robb Stark : There are no direwolves south of the Wall.

Jon Snow : Now there are five.

Jon Snow : You want to hold it?

Bran Stark : Where will they go? Their mother's dead.

Cassel : They don't belong down here.

Eddard Stark : Better a quick death. They won't last without their mother.

Theon Greyjoy : Right. Give it here.

Bran Stark : NO!

Robb Stark : Put away your blade.

Theon Greyjoy : I take orders from your father, not you.

Bran Stark : Please, father!

Eddard Stark : I'm sorry, Bran.

Jon Snow : Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.

Eddard Stark : You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.

Bran Stark : What about you?

Jon Snow : I'm not a Stark. Get on.

Robb Stark : What is it?

Theon Greyjoy : The runt of the litter. That one's yours, Snow.

Jaime Lannister : As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you

Cersei Lannister : And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid.

Jaime Lannister : There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We're Lannisters. Lannisters don't act like fools.

Cersei Lannister : What if Jon Arryn told someone?

Jaime Lannister : But who would he tell?

Cersei Lannister : My husband.

Jaime Lannister : If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.

Cersei Lannister : You should be the Hand of the king.

Jaime Lannister : That's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.

Catelyn Stark : All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.

Eddard Stark : You have five northern children. You're not an outsider.

Catelyn Stark : I wonder if the old gods agree.

Eddard Stark : It's your gods with all the rules.

Catelyn Stark : I am so sorry, my love.

Eddard Stark : Tell me.

Catelyn Stark : There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.

Eddard Stark : Your sister. The boy .

Catelyn Stark : They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.

Eddard Stark : He's coming this far North, there's only one thing he's after.

Catelyn Stark : You can always say no, Ned.

Catelyn Stark : We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night.

Maester Luwin : I'm told he drinks all night.

Catelyn Stark : How much could he possibly drink? A man of his . stature.

Luwin : We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out.

Catelyn Stark : In any case, candles.

Jon Snow : Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?

Theon Greyjoy : It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's [sleek as a mink?]

Robb Stark : I hear the prince is a right royal prick.

Theon Greyjoy : Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.

Robb Stark : Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.

Catelyn Stark : Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!

Bran Stark : I saw the king! He's got hundreds of people!

Catelyn Stark : How many times have I told you

Bran Stark : But he's coming right now! Down our road!

Catelyn Stark : I want you to promise me

Bran Stark : I promise.

Catelyn Stark : D'you know what?

Bran Stark : What?

Catelyn Stark : You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.

Catelyn Stark : Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?

Eddard Stark : Hey,, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? [Pulls off ARYA's helm]

Arya Stark : Move!

Eddard Stark : Your Grace.

Robert Baratheon : You've got fat.

Robert Baratheon : Cat!

Catelyn Stark : Your Grace.

Robert Baratheon : Nine years. Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?

Eddard Stark : Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.

Arya Stark : Where's the Imp?

Sansa Stark : Will you shut up?

Robert Baratheon : Who have we here? You must be Robb. My, you're a pretty one. Your name is?

Arya Stark : Arya.

Robert Baratheon : Ooh. Show us your muscles. You'll be a soldier.

Arya Stark : That's Jaime Lannister. The queen's twin brother.

Sansa Stark : Would you please shut up.

Eddard Stark : My queen.

Catelyn Stark : My queen.

Robert Baratheon : Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.

Cersei Lannister : We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.

Robert Baratheon : Ned.

Cersei Lannister : Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.

Eddard Stark : Tell me about Jon Arryn.

Robert Baratheon : One minute he was fine, and then . Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.

Eddard Stark : We both did.

Robert Baratheon : He never had to teach you much, but me . You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what.

Eddard Stark : Aye.

Robert Baratheon : Don't look at me like that. Not his fault I didn't listen. I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king.

Eddard Stark : I'm not worthy of the honor.

Robert Baratheon : I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our Houses.

Tyrion Lannister : Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.

Ros : Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?

Tyrion Lannister : I did hear something about that.

Ros : And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.

Tyrion Lannister : And the other brother?

Ros : The queen has two brothers?

Tyrion Lannister : There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.

Ros : I hear they call him the Imp.

Tyrion Lannister : I hear he hates that nickname.

Ros : Oh? I hear he's more than earned it. I hear he's a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.

Tyrion Lannister : Clever girl.

Ros : We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.

Tyrion Lannister : Have you?

Tyrion Lannister : The gods gave me one blessing.

Jaime Lannister : Don't get up.

Ros : M'lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?

Jaime Lannister : You've much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention.

Tyrion Lannister : She has odd cravings, our sister.

Jaime Lannister : A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don't leave me alone with these people.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.

Jaime Lannister : I thought you might say that. But since we're short on time, Come on, girls. See you at sundown.

Tyrion Lannister : Close the door!

Robert Baratheon : Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.

Eddard Stark : She was my sister. This is where she belongs.

Robert Baratheon : She belonged with me.

Robert Baratheon : In my dreams, I kill him every night.

Eddard Stark : It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.

Robert Baratheon : Not all of them.

Viserys : Daenerys!

Viserys : Daenerys! There's our bride to be! Look - a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn't he a gracious host?

Daenerys Targaryen : We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.

Viserys : Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. You have a woman's body now. I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?

Daenerys Targaryen : No.

Viserys : When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.

Maid : It's too hot, my lady.

Viserys : Where is he?

Illyrio : The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.

Illyrio : May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen.

Viserys : Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen.

Illyrio : Come forward, my dear.

Viserys : Where's he going?

Illyrio : The ceremony is over.

Viserys : But he didn't say anything. Did he like her?

Illyrio : Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn't like her, we'd know.

Illyrio : It won't be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.

Viserys : When will they be married?

Illyrio : Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.

Viserys : Is it true they lie with their horses?

Illyrio : I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.

Viserys : Do you take me for a fool?

Illyrio : I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.

Viserys : I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.

Daenerys Targaryen : I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home.

Viserys : So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?

Daenerys Targaryen : I don't know.

Viserys : We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took.

Sansa Stark : Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?

Catelyn Stark : Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.

Sansa Stark : He's so handsome.

Sansa Stark : When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?

Catelyn Stark : Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.

Sansa Stark : Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.

Catelyn Stark : He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.

Sansa Stark : You left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make father say yes.

Catelyn Stark : Sansa.

Sansa Stark : Please, please. It's the only thing I ever wanted.

Benjen : Is he dead yet?

Jon Snow : Uncle Benjen!

Benjen : You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?

Jon Snow : Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.

Benjen : Well, you're always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there.

Jon Snow : So take me with you when you go back.

Benjen : Jon.

Jon Snow : Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will.

Benjen : The Wall isn't going anywhere.

Jon Snow : I'm ready to swear your oath.

Benjen : You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.

Jon Snow : I don't care about that.

Benjen : You might, if you knew what it meant. . I'd better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later.

Tyrion Lannister : Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.

Jon Snow : What're you doing back there?

Tyrion Lannister : Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.

Jon Snow : You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?

Tyrion Lannister : My greatest accomplishment. You - you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?

Tyrion Lannister : Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.

Jon Snow : Lord Eddard Stark is my father.

Tyrion Lannister : And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.

Jon Snow : What the hell do you know about being a bastard?

Tyrion Lannister : All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.

Benjen : You at a feast -- It's like a bear in a trap.

Eddard Stark : The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?

Benjen : Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger.

Eddard Stark : He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.

Benjen : The two he was with are still missing.

Eddard Stark : A wildling ambush.

Benjen : Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.

Eddard Stark : Winter is coming.

Robb Stark : Uncle Benjen.

Benjen : Robb boy. How are ye?

Robb Stark : I'm good.

Catelyn Stark : Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?

Cersei Lannister : Yes. Lovely country.

Catelyn Stark : I'm sure it's very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.

Cersei Lannister : Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?

Sansa Stark : Thirteen, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : You're tall. Still growing?

Sansa Stark : I think so, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : And have you bled yet?

Sansa Stark : No, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : And your dress. Did you make it?

Cersei Lannister : Such talent. You must make something for me.

Cersei Lannister : I hear we might share a grandchild someday.

Catelyn Stark : I hear the same.

Cersei Lannister : Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.

Eddard Stark : Your pardon.

Jaime Lannister : I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it's true.

Eddard Stark : Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.

Jaime Lannister : I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale.

Eddard Stark : I don't fight in tournaments.

Jaime Lannister : No? Getting a little old for it?

Eddard Stark : I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do.

Jaime Lannister : Well said.

Sansa Stark : Arya!

Robb Stark : Time for bed.

Eddard Stark : I'm a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat's nest they call a capital.

Catelyn Stark : I won't let him take you.

Eddard Stark : The king takes what he wants. That's why he's king.

Catelyn Stark : I'll say, 'Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.'

Eddard Stark : How did he get so fat?

Catelyn Stark : He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.

A Voice : It's Maester Luwin, my lord.

Eddard Stark : Send him in.

Luwin : Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister.

Eddard Stark : Stay.

Catelyn Stark : This was sent from the Eyrie. What's she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn't been back there since her wedding.

Eddard Stark : What news?

Catelyn Stark : She's fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.

Eddard Stark : She's fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn't know what she's saying.

Catelyn Stark : Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son's life, if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?

Luwin : If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?

Catelyn Stark : They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.

Luwin : The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark's help. He's the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord.

Catelyn Stark : He spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. He owes him nothing. Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.

Luwin : A different time. Different king.

Viserys : When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion.

Illyrio : If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it.

Viserys : When?

Illyrio : When their omens favor war.

Viserys : I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back.

Illyrio : A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.

Jorah Mormont : A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.

Daenerys Targaryen : Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?

Jorah Mormont : Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.

Illyrio : Dragons' eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful.

Daenerys Targaryen : Thank you, Magister.

Daenerys Targaryen : She's beautiful. . Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say 'thank you' in Dothraki.

Jorah Mormont : There is no word for 'thank you' in Dothraki.

Viserys : Make him happy.

Khal Drogo : No.

Daenerys Targaryen : Do you know the Common Tongue?

Daenerys Targaryen : Is 'no' the only word that you know?

Sandor Clegane : Rough night, Imp?

Tyrion Lannister : If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle.

Sandor Clegane : I didn't pick you for a hunter.

Tyrion Lannister : The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.

Sandor Clegane : It's not hunting if you pay for it.

Robert Baratheon : Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?

Eddard Stark : No, but I'm still better than you.

Robert Baratheon : I know what I'm putting you through. Thank you for saying yes. I only ask you because I need you. You're a loyal friend. You hear me? A loyal friend. The last one I've got.

Eddard Stark : I hope I'll serve you well.

Robert Baratheon : You will. And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time. Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar!

Bran Stark : Come on, you.

Cersei Lannister : Stop. STOP.

Jaime Lannister : Are you completely mad?

Cersei Lannister : He saw us.

Jaime Lannister : It's all right. It's all right.

Cersei Lannister : He saw us!

Jaime Lannister : I heard you the first time. Quite the little climber, aren't you? How old are you, boy?

Bran Stark : Ten

Jaime Lannister : Ten.

Jaime Lannister : The things I do for love.

Jorah Mormont : You need to drink, child... And eat.

Daenerys Targaryen : Isn't there anything else?

Jorah Mormont : The Dothraki have two things in abundance

Doreah : Khaleesi!

Irri : Your hands.

Jorah Mormont : We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there.

Viserys Targaryen : I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.

Jorah Mormont : As you wish, your Grace.

Viserys Targaryen : Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?

Jorah Mormont : Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.

Viserys Targaryen : Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that.

Joffrey Lannister : Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today.

Tyrion Lannister : Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.

Joffrey Lannister : What good will my sympathies do them?

Tyrion Lannister : None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.

Joffrey Lannister : The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.

Tyrion Lannister : One word and I'll hit you again.

Joffrey Lannister : I'm telling mother!

Tyrion Lannister : Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?

Joffrey Lannister : You can't...

Tyrion Lannister : Do you understand?

Sandor Clegane : The Prince will remember that, little lord.

Tyrion Lannister : I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast...

Tyrion Lannister : Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black.

Jaime Lannister : Little brother.

Tyrion Lannister : Beloved siblings.

Myrcella Baratheon : Is Bran going to die?

Tyrion Lannister : Apparently not.

Cersei Lannister : What do you mean?

Tyrion Lannister : The Maester says the boy may live.

Cersei Lannister : It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.

Tyrion Lannister : Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.

Cersei Lannister : I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.

Tyrion Lannister : Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.

Jaime Lannister : Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.

Tyrion Lannister : And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.

Cersei Lannister : The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.

Jaime Lannister : Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day.

Tyrion Lannister : Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.

Jaime Lannister : My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.

Tyrion Lannister : My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family.

Cersei Lannister : Please.

Catelyn Stark : I would have dressed, your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now.

Catelyn Stark : I never knew.

Cersei Lannister : It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.

Catelyn Stark : I am grateful..

Cersei Lannister : Perhaps this time she'll listen.

Jaime Lannister : A sword for the wall?

Jon Snow : I already have one.

Jaime Lannister : Good man. Have you swung it yet?

Jon Snow : Of course I have.

Jaime Lannister : At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.

Jon Snow : We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.

Jaime Lannister : Is it "we" already? Have you taken your vows then?

Jon Snow : Soon enough.

Jaime Lannister : Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life.

Arya Stark : Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. "My things weren't properly folded", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.

Jon Snow : It's good you've got help.

Arya Stark : Watch. Nymeria, gloves.

Jon Snow : Impressive.

Arya Stark : Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!

Jon Snow : I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.

Arya Stark : A present?

Jon Snow : Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.

Arya Stark : It's so skinny.

Jon Snow : So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.

Arya Stark : I can be quick.

Jon Snow : You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?

Arya Stark : I think so.

Jon Snow : First lesson

Arya Stark : I know which end to use.

Jon Snow : I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know.

Arya Stark : Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.

Jon Snow : I came to say goodbye to Bran.

Catelyn Stark : You've said it.

Jon Snow : I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid.

Catelyn Stark : I want you to leave.

Catelyn Stark : 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.

Eddard Stark : I have no choice.

Catelyn Stark : That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't.

Eddard Stark : You can. You must.

Robb Stark : You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.

Jon Snow : You Starks are hard to kill.

Robb Stark : My mother?

Jon Snow : She was very kind.

Robb Stark : Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.

Jon Snow : It was always my color.

Robb Stark : Farewell, Snow.

Jon Snow : And you, Stark.

Eddard Stark : There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood.

Jon Snow : Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?

Eddard Stark : The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise.

Robert Baratheon : Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.

Eddard Stark : I've half a mind to go with you.

Robert Baratheon : What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.

Eddard Stark : You should have asked me 20 years ago.

Robert Baratheon : There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young.

Eddard Stark : I recall a few chances.

Robert Baratheon : There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.

Eddard Stark : Bessie. She was one of yours.

Robert Baratheon : Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastardo s mother?

Eddard Stark : Wylla.

Robert Baratheon : That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.

Eddard Stark : Nor will I.

Robert Baratheon : We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.

Eddard Stark : The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.

Robert Baratheon : Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night.

Eddard Stark : Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?

Robert Baratheon : A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.

Eddard Stark : She's little more than a child.

Robert Baratheon : Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.

Eddard Stark : Tell me we're not speaking of this.

Robert Baratheon : Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.

Eddard Stark : But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?

Robert Baratheon : This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde.

Eddard Stark : Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert.

Robert Baratheon : There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him.

Eddard Stark : He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.

Robert Baratheon : There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.

Benjen Stark : Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.

Tyrion Lannister : Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.

Jon Snow : Why do you read so much?

Tyrion Lannister : Look at me and tell me what you see.

Jon Snow : Is this a trick?

Tyrion Lannister : What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.

Jon Snow : Until your brother killed that King.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?

Jon Snow : Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.

Tyrion Lannister : A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.

Jon Snow : The Night's Watch protects the realm from...

Tyrion Lannister : Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly.

Maester Luwin : It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.

Catelyn Stark : Talk to Poole about it.

Maester Luwin : Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention...

Catelyn Stark : I don't care about appointments!

Robb Stark : I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.

Maester Luwin : Very good, my Lord. My Lady.

Robb Stark : When was the last time you left this room?

Catelyn Stark : I have to take care of him.

Robb Stark : He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.

Catelyn Stark : What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.

Robb Stark : Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying...

Catelyn Stark : Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop!

Robb Stark : Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.

Assassin : You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.

Catelyn Stark : No!

Daenerys Targaryen : Have you ever seen a dragon?

Irri : Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : Everywhere? Even in the east?

Irri : No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.

Jhiqui : It is known.

Doreah : A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.

Daenerys Targaryen : The moon?

Doreah : He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.

Irri : Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.

Daenerys Targaryen : Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?

Doreah : Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.

Daenerys Targaryen : How old were you?

Doreah : I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.

Daenerys Targaryen : Nine?!

Doreah : I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn.

Daenerys Targaryen : Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?

Doreah : Yes.

Daenerys Targaryen : Will it take three years?

Doreah : No.

Benjen Stark : Welcome.

Catelyn Stark : What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.

Maester Luwin : The boy was always sure-footed before.

Catelyn Stark : Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.

Theon Greyjoy : Saw what, my lady?

Catelyn Stark : I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.

Rodrick Cassel : Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him.

Robb Stark : They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...

Theon Greyjoy : If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.

Maester Luwin : What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this.

Catelyn Stark : I don't trust a raven to carry these words.

Robb Stark : I'll ride to King's Landing.

Catelyn Stark : No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.

Robb Stark : Mother, you can't.

Catelyn Stark : I must.

Rodrick Cassel : I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.

Catelyn Stark : Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.

Rodrick Cassel : Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.

Robb Stark : What about Bran?

Catelyn Stark : I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.

Doreah : No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.

Daenerys Targaryen : Finish a man?

Doreah : Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.

Daenerys Targaryen : Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.

Doreah : You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.

Daenerys Targaryen : I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.

Doreah : If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?

Daenerys Targaryen : No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.

Sansa Stark : Pardon me, Ser.

Sandor Clegane : Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face.

Sansa Stark : I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?

Sandor Clegane : He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.

Joffrey Lannister : He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me.

Sansa Stark : Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.

Joffrey Lannister : My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.

Mycah : I'll get you!

Sansa Stark : Arya!

Arya Stark : What are you doing here? Go away.

Joffrey Lannister : Your sister? And who are you, boy?

Mycah : Mycah, my Lord.

Sansa Stark : He the butcher's boy.

Arya Stark : He's my friend.

Joffrey Lannister : A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.

Mycah : She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.

Joffrey Lannister : I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.

Mycah : It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.

Joffrey Lannister : And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?

Arya Stark : Stop it!

Sansa Stark : Arya, stay out of this.

Joffrey Lannister : I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!

Sansa Stark : No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!

Joffrey Lannister : I'll gut you, you little cunt!

Arya Stark : Nymeria!

Joffrey Lannister : Please don't.

Sansa Stark : Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.

Joffrey Lannister : Then go! Don't touch me.

Soldier : The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.

Arya Stark : You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!

Soldier : It's a direwolf.

Soldier : I'll check down here.

Soldier : I think I heard a noise.

Arya Stark : Go!

Jory Cassel : My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.

Eddard Stark : Where is she?

Jory Cassel : She's been taken directly before the King.

Eddard Stark : Who took her?

Jory Cassel : The Lannisters found her.

Eddard Stark : Right, get back.

Jory Cassel : The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.

Eddard Stark : Back! Back to the inn. All back!

Arya Stark : I'm sorry.

Eddard Stark : Are you hurt?

Arya Stark : No.

Eddard Stark : It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?

Cersei Lannister : How dare you speak to your King in that manner?

Robert Baratheon : Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly.

Cersei Lannister : Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.

Arya Stark : That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.

Cersei Lannister : Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.

Arya Stark : That's not what happened!

Joffrey Lannister : Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.

Arya Stark : Liar!

Joffrey Lannister : Shut up!

Robert Baratheon : Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?

Eddard Stark : In bed asleep.

Cersei Lannister : She's not. Sansa, come here, darling.

Robert Baratheon : Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King.

Sansa Stark : I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.

Arya Stark : Liar! Liar liar liar!

Eddard Stark : Stop it! That's enough of that.

Arya Stark : Liar liar liar!

Eddard Stark : Stop! Arya!

Cersei Lannister : She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.

Robert Baratheon : What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over.

Cersei Lannister : Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.

Robert Baratheon : You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.

Eddard Stark : Gladly, your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?

Robert Baratheon : I'd forgot the damned wolf.

Soldier : We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.

Robert Baratheon : So be it.

Cersei Lannister : We have another wolf.

Robert Baratheon : As you will.

Eddard Stark : You can't mean it.

Robert Baratheon : A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.

Sansa Stark : He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!

Arya Stark : Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!

Sansa Stark : Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!

Eddard Stark : s this your command... your Grace?

Cersei Lannister : Where is the beast?

Soldier : Chained up outside, your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.

Eddard Stark : No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself.

Cersei Lannister : Is this some trick?

Eddard Stark : The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.

Eddard Stark : The butcher's boy... You rode him down?

Sandor Clegane : He ran... Not very fast.

Kings Landing Guard : Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested.

Eddard Stark : Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them.

Jory Cassel : Yes, my Lord.

Kings Landing Guard : If you'd like to change into something more appropriate.

Jaime Lannister : Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.

Eddard Stark : Glad to see you're protecting the throne.

Jaime Lannister : Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes.

Eddard Stark : Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.

Jaime Lannister : I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.

Eddard Stark : You've chosen your opponents wisely then.

Jaime Lannister : I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.

Eddard Stark : But you just stood there and watched.

Jaime Lannister : 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.

Eddard Stark : Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?

Jaime Lannister : Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?

Eddard Stark : You served him well, when serving was safe.

Varys : Lord Stark.

Eddard Stark : Lord Varys.

Varys : I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.

Eddard Stark : A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.

Renly Baratheon : And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but...

Petyr Baelish : But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.

Eddard Stark : She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.

Petyr Baelish : All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.

Eddard Stark : Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.

Petyr Baelish : It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.

Grand Maester Pycelle : I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.

Eddard Stark : Grand Maester.

Grand Maester Pycelle : How many years has it been? You were a young man.

Eddard Stark : And you served another King.

Grand Maester Pycelle : How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?

Eddard Stark : Without the King?

Renly Baratheon : Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.

Varys : His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.

Petyr Baelish : We are the lords of small matters here.

Renly Baratheon : My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.

Petyr Baelish : Mmm, how much?

Eddard Stark : 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.

Grand Maester Pycelle : Can the treasury bear such expense?

Petyr Baelish : I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?

Eddard Stark : Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?

Petyr Baelish : I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.

Eddard Stark : How could you let this happen?

Petyr Baelish : The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.

Eddard Stark : I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.

Grand Maester Pycelle : Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.

Renly Baratheon : Counting coppers," he calls it.

Eddard Stark : I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.

Petyr Baelish : As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.

Eddard Stark : There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.

Varys : You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.

Cersei Lannister : Please, it's nearly healed.

Joffrey Lannister : It's ugly.

Cersei Lannister : A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.

Joffrey Lannister : I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.

Cersei Lannister : That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.

Joffrey Lannister : Do I have to marry her?

Cersei Lannister : Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.

Joffrey Lannister : I don't want to.

Cersei Lannister : No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.

Joffrey Lannister : We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.

Cersei Lannister : How would you handle them?

Joffrey Lannister : I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.

Cersei Lannister : A royal army?

Joffrey Lannister : Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.

Cersei Lannister : And if the northerners rebel?

Joffrey Lannister : I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.

Cersei Lannister : And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?

Joffrey Lannister : For me. I'm their King.

Cersei Lannister : But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.

Joffrey Lannister : I'm not asking.

Cersei Lannister : The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.

Joffrey Lannister : So you agree... The Starks are enemies?

Cersei Lannister : Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.

Septa Mordane : Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.

Arya Stark : I'm practicing.

Sansa Stark : Practicing for what?

Arya Stark : The Prince.

Septa Mordane : Arya, stop!

Arya Stark : He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.

Sansa Stark : The Hound killed your friend.

Arya Stark : The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.

Sansa Stark : You're an idiot.

Arya Stark : You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.

Septa Mordane : Enough!

Eddard Stark : What's happening here?

Septa Mordane : Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.

Eddard Stark : Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love.

Eddard Stark : The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?

Sansa Stark : I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?

Septa Mordane : You've barely eaten a thing.

Eddard Stark : It's all right. Go on.

Eddard Stark : War was easier than daughters.

Arya Stark : Go away!

Eddard Stark : Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?

Arya Stark : Mine.

Eddard Stark : Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.

Arya Stark : I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.

Eddard Stark : Come here. Now what do you want with this?

Arya Stark : It's called Needle.

Eddard Stark : A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?

Arya Stark : Stick 'em with the pointy end.

Eddard Stark : laughs] That's the essence of it.

Arya Stark : I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.

Eddard Stark : No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy.

Arya Stark : I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.

Eddard Stark : Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.

Arya Stark : So was I! He is a liar.

Eddard Stark : Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.

Arya Stark : But how you can let her marry someone like that?

Eddard Stark : Well. Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.

Arya Stark : Winter is coming.

Eddard Stark : You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.

Arya Stark : I don't hate her. Not really.

Eddard Stark : I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours.

Arya Stark : I can keep it?

Eddard Stark : Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.

Old Nan : Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.

Bran Stark : I hate your stories.

Old Nan : I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.

Bran Stark : Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.

Old Nan : Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds.

Robb Stark : What are you telling him now?

Old Nan : Only what the little Lord wants to hear.

Robb Stark : Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.

Bran Stark : Maybe we do.

Robb Stark : How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.

Bran Stark : I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead.

Robb Stark : Don't ever say that.

Bran Stark : I'd rather be dead.

Rodrick Cassel : Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many.

Catelyn Stark : It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.

Rodrick Cassel : My Lady.

Guard : Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?

Catelyn Stark : I would. We've done nothing wrong.

Guard : We've been instructed to escort you into the city.

Catelyn Stark : Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but...

Guard : Follow me, Lady Stark.

Petyr Baelish : Cat! Go on. Go upstairs.

Catelyn Stark : You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a.

Petyr Baelish : I meant no disrespect to you of all people.

Catelyn Stark : How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?

Petyr Baelish : No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.

Catelyn Stark : How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?

Petyr Baelish : A dear friend told me.

Varys : Lady Stark.

Catelyn Stark : Lord Varys.

Varys : To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.

Catelyn Stark : How did you know I was coming?

Varys : Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.

Catelyn Stark : Do you know whose dagger this is?

Varys : I must admit I do not.

Petyr Baelish : Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.

Catelyn Stark : Yours?

Petyr Baelish : At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.

Catelyn Stark : To whom?

Petyr Baelish : Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.

Alliser Thorne : If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?

Alliser Thorne : Next!

Alliser Thorne : Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day.

Tyrion Lannister : A charming man.

Jeor Mormont : I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.

Tyrion Lannister : And how's that going, Commander Mormont?

Jeor Mormont : Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.

Tyrion Lannister : Good news or bad?

Jeor Mormont : Both.

Grand Maester Pycelle : Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.

Petyr Baelish : Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?

Eddard Stark : My wife is in Winterfell.

Petyr Baelish : Is she?

Petyr Baelish : I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.

Eddard Stark : You're a funny man. A very funny man.

Catelyn Stark : Ned! [poking her head out of a window]

Petyr Baelish : The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds.

Grenn : You broke my nose, bastard!

Jon Snow : It's an improvement.

Grenn : If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit.

Pyp : I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.

Grenn : What're you looking at, halfman?

Tyrion Lannister : I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.

Rast : What do you care about our faces?

Tyrion Lannister : It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.

Grenn : We'll talk later, Lord Snow.

Jon Snow : Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.

Tyrion Lannister : Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice

Jon Snow : They hate me because I'm better than they are.

Tyrion Lannister : It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.

Petyr Baelish : The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.

Catelyn Stark : We have proof. We have the blade.

Petyr Baelish : Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.

Catelyn Stark : Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.

Petyr Baelish : I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.

Catelyn Stark : I won't forget this. You're a true friend.

Petyr Baelish : Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.

Cersei Lannister : How could you be so stupid?

Jaime Lannister : Calm down.

Cersei Lannister : He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?

Jaime Lannister : I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?

Cersei Lannister : Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.

Jaime Lannister : Then what are you raving about?

Cersei Lannister : What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...

Jaime Lannister : We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.

Cersei Lannister : And my husband?

Jaime Lannister : I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us

Cersei Lannister : Let me go.

Jaime Lannister : Never.

Jaime Lannister : The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.

Catelyn Stark : I wish I could see the girls.

Eddard Stark : It's too dangerous.

Catelyn Stark : Just for a moment.

Eddard Stark : Until we know who our enemies are...

Catelyn Stark : I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it.

Eddard Stark : Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.

Cersei Lannister : And if you find the proof?

Eddard Stark : Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.

Catelyn Stark : My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.

Eddard Stark : He still loves you.

Catelyn Stark : Does he?

Eddard Stark : Off with you.

Robert Baratheon : It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?

Barristan Selmy : Of course, your Grace.

Robert Baratheon : Who was it?

Barristan Selmy : A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.

Robert Baratheon : How'd you do it?

Barristan Selmy : Lance through the heart.

Robert Baratheon : Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, "Wait! Wait!"... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?

Lancel Lannister : It's empty, your Grace.

Robert Baratheon : What do you mean it's empty?

Lancel Lannister : There's no more wine.

Robert Baratheon : Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?

Jaime Lannister : One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.

Barristan Selmy : I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old.

Jaime Lannister : You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.

Barristan Selmy : A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.

Robert Baratheon : Your outlaw... Any last words?

Jaime Lannister : I cut his head off, so no.

Robert Baratheon : What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?

Jaime Lannister : He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... "Burn them all." If that's all, your Grace...

Jorah Mormont : The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.

Daenerys Targaryen : From whom?

Jorah Mormont : If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices

Daenerys Targaryen : Tell them all to stop.

Jorah Mormont : You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?

Daenerys Targaryen : Until I command them otherwise.

Jorah Mormont : You're learning to talk like a Queen.

Daenerys Targaryen : Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.

Viserys Targaryen : You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?

Irri : Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : No!

Irri : Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect.

Daenerys Targaryen : Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.

Viserys Targaryen : Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!

Jorah Mormont : Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?

Rakharo : You walk. [to Viserys]

Benjen Stark : I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.

Jon Snow : You're leaving?

Benjen Stark : I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.

Jon Snow : What kind of reports?

Benjen Stark : The kind I don't want to believe.

Jon Snow : m ready. I won't let you down.

Benjen Stark : You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon.

Jon Snow : But I'm better than every...

Benjen Stark : Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return.

Yoren : A bear's balls.

Tyrion Lannister : You're joking?

Yoren : And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.

Tyrion Lannister : And how do a bear's balls taste?

Yoren : A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?

Tyrion Lannister : Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?

Yoren : But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.

Tyrion Lannister : They have a better chance finding feed than glory.

Benjen Stark : The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?

Tyrion Lannister : You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.

Benjen Stark : I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?

Benjen Stark : Call me what you like.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.

Benjen Stark : You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word "but" really counts.

Tyrion Lannister : But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.

Benjen Stark : You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there.

Yoren : Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm.

Benjen Stark : Enjoy the capital, brother.

Yoren : I always do.

Tyrion Lannister : I think he's starting to like me. "Going below"?

Yoren : Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.

Tyrion Lannister : So you're heading down to King's Landing too.

Yoren : Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.

Tyrion Lannister : Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.

Yoren : I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.

Irri : Yes, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : What are you doing?

Irri : When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It's a blessing from the Great Stallion.

Jorah Mormont : For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate.

Rakharo : Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.

Jorah Mormont : Armor.

Rakharo : Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?

Jorah Mormont : Slow.

Rakharo : Slow.

Jorah Mormont : It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.

Rakharo : My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.

Jorah Mormont : I've heard that your father was a famous warrior.

Rakharo : He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?

Jorah Mormont : He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.

Irri : The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.

Rakharo : There are no rabbits.

Irri : Find some ducks, she likes ducks.

Rakharo : Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?

Irri : Dog then. I have seen many dogs.

Jorah Mormont : I don't think she wants to eat dog.

Irri : The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.

Rakharo : A blessing from the Great Stallion.

Irri : She does not want to eat horse.

Jorah Mormont : I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.

Rhakaro : We ride for Vaes Dothrak.

Jorah Mormont : Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.

Jon Snow : Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.

Maester Aemon : How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?

Tyrion Lannister : Eight... no, nine.

Maester Aemon : All of them brief?

Tyrion Lannister : They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.

Maester Aemon : This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually

Jeor Mormont : We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.

Jeor Mormont : One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.

Maester Aemon : The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.

Jeor Mormont : Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.

Maester Aemon : When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready.

Daenerys Targaryen : It's a boy.

Khal Drogo : How do you know?

Daenerys Targaryen : I know.

Jon Snow : I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister : It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.

Jon Snow : Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?

Tyrion Lannister : I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.

Jon Snow : If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course.

Jon Snow : He'll never walk again.

Tyrion Lannister : If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.

Jon Snow : Farewell, My Lord.

Syrio Forel : You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday.

Arya Stark : Who are you?

Syrio Forel : Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.

Syrio Forel : Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it.

Arya Stark : It's too heavy.

Syrio Forel : It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.

Arya Stark : What if I drop it?

Syrio Forel : The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy.

Arya Stark : I'm a girl.

Syrio Forel : Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding...

Arya Stark : A needle.

Syrio Forel : Ahhh. Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me.

Syrio Forel : Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster.

Old Nan : The little Lordo s been dreaming again.

Theon Greyjoy : We have visitors.

Bran Stark : I don't want to see anyone.

Theon Greyjoy : Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.

Bran Stark : I don't want to go.

Theon Greyjoy : Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! Help Bran down the hall.

Tyrion Lannister : I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.

Robb Stark : Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.

Tyrion Lannister : Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?

Robb Stark : I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.

Tyrion Lannister : Then you might learn a lordo s courtesy.

Tyrion Lannister : So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?

Maester Luwin : He has no memory of that day.

Tyrion Lannister : Curious.

Robb Stark : Why are you here?

Tyrion Lannister : Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.

Bran Stark : Kneel, Hodor.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you like to ride, Bran?

Bran Stark : Yes. Well, I mean I did like to.

Maester Luwin : The boy has lost the use of his legs.

Tyrion Lannister : What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.

Bran Stark : I'm not a cripple.

Tyrion Lannister : Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.

Bran Stark : Will I really be able to ride?

Tyrion Lannister : You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.

Robb Stark : Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?

Tyrion Lannister : I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.

Robb Stark : You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.

Tyrion Lannister : Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.

Theon Greyjoy : Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros.

Tyrion Lannister : Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.

Theon Greyjoy : He's not my master.

Tyrion Lannister : No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?

Theon Greyjoy : She wasn't feeling well.

Tyrion Lannister : She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?

Theon Greyjoy : My lady's whereabouts...

Tyrion Lannister : My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?

Theon Greyjoy : Must have been a pretty sight.

Tyrion Lannister : Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out.

Theon Greyjoy : We were outnumbered 10 to one.

Tyrion Lannister : A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire.

Theon Greyjoy : Careful, Imp.

Tyrion Lannister : I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out.

Jon Snow : Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it.

Grenn : What in seven hells is that?

Pyp : They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.

Alliser Thorne : Tell them your name.

Sam Tarly : Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black.

Rast : Come to take the black pudding.

Alliser Thorne : Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. See what he can do.

Sam Tarly : I yield. Please, no more.

Alliser Thorne : On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder.

Jon Snow : Enough! He yielded.

Alliser Thorne : Looks like the bastardo s in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard.

Jon Snow : Are you sure you want to do this?

Grenn : No. Yield yield yield! I yield.

Alliser Thorne : We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.

Pyp : Well fought!

Grenn : Piss off.

Sam Tarly : Did he hurt you?

Jon Snow : I've had worse.

Sam Tarly : You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.

Jon Snow : It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself.

Grenn : Why didn't you get up and fight?

Sam Tarly : I wanted to. I just couldn't.

Grenn : Why not?

Sam Tarly : I'm a coward. My father always says so.

Jon Snow : The Wall's no place for cowards.

Sam Tarly : You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.

Grenn : A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.

Pyp : You're too stupid to be a coward.

Grenn : You're too stupid to be a...

Pyp : Quick now, before summer's over.

Grenn : Come on here!

Jorah Mormont : Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.

Viserys Targaryen : A pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs - best these savages can do.

Daenerys Targaryen : These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.

Viserys Targaryen : I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.

Daenerys Targaryen : If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

Jorah Mormont : The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.

Daenerys Targaryen : But if they did?

Jorah Mormont : King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.

Daenerys Targaryen : And you know these men?

Jorah Mormont : I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land.

Daenerys Targaryen : You sold slaves.

Jorah Mormont : Aye.

Daenerys Targaryen : Why?

Jorah Mormont : I had no money and an expensive wife.

Daenerys Targaryen : And where is she now?

Jorah Mormont : In another place, with another man.

Doreah : Your Grace?

Viserys Targaryen : Yes, my dear?

Doreah : They call you the last dragon...

Viserys Targaryen : They do.

Doreah : You have dragon's blood in your veins?

Viserys Targaryen : It's entirely possible.

Doreah : What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.

Viserys Targaryen : The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles.

Doreah : I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.

Viserys Targaryen : Really? Why dragons?

Doreah : They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy.

Viserys Targaryen : Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.

Doreah : I was not locked in. I have seen things.

Viserys Targaryen : What have you seen?

Doreah : I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?

Viserys Targaryen : A pirate ship?

Doreah : A dragon.

Viserys Targaryen : No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen

Doreah : What happened to the skulls?

Viserys Targaryen : I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind.

Doreah : That's very sad.

Viserys Targaryen : Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?

Doreah : No, your Grace. To teach your sister.

Viserys Targaryen : To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.

Septa Mordane : Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince...

Sansa Stark : What if I have a girl?

Septa Mordane : Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.

Sansa Stark : What if I only have girls?

Septa Mordane : I wouldn't worry about that.

Sansa Stark : Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls.

Septa Mordane : Yes, but it's highly unlikely.

Sansa Stark : But what if?

Septa Mordane : If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother.

Sansa Stark : And everyone would hate me.

Septa Mordane : Nobody could ever hate you.

Sansa Stark : Joffrey does.

Septa Mordane : Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...

Sansa Stark : Please shut up about it.

Septa Mordane : Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?

Sansa Stark : Aegon the Conqueror.

Septa Mordane : And who built the Red Keep?

Sansa Stark : Maegor the Cruel.

Septa Mordane : And how many years did it take to build...

Sansa Stark : My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?

Septa Mordane : They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes.

Sansa Stark : The Mad King.

Septa Mordane : Commonly known as the Mad King.

Sansa Stark : Why were they killed?

Septa Mordane : You should speak to your father about these matters.

Sansa Stark : I don't want to speak to my father, ever.

Septa Mordane : You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.

Sansa Stark : No, I won't.

Janos Slynt : It's the Hando s tournament that's causing all this trouble, my Lords.

Eddard Stark : The King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.

Janos Slynt : Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters.

Varys : Dreadful.

Renly Baratheon : If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.

Janos Slynt : I need more men.

Eddard Stark : You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.

Petyr Baelish : I will?

Eddard Stark : You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left.

Janos Slynt : Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser. They will be put to good use.

Eddard Stark : The sooner this is over, the better.

Varys : The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.

Petyr Baelish : And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.

Eddard Stark : I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?

Grand Maester Pycelle : This heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows. Until tomorrow my Lord.

Eddard Stark : I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.

Grand Maester Pycelle : Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.

Eddard Stark : Why?

Grand Maester Pycelle : I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...

Eddard Stark : What did Jon want the night before he died?

Grand Maester Pycelle : He came inquiring after a book.

Eddard Stark : A book? What book?

Grand Maester Pycelle : I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome.

Eddard Stark : I'd like to read it.

Grand Maester Pycelle : The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children.

Eddard Stark : Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained

Grand Maester Pycelle : As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read.

Eddard Stark : Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?

Grand Maester Pycelle : He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask.

Eddard Stark : Jon's death...

Grand Maester Pycelle : Such a tragedy.

Eddard Stark : Did he say anything to you during his final hours?

Grand Maester Pycelle : Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating

Eddard Stark : The seed is strong"? What does that mean?

Grand Maester Pycelle : The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words.

Eddard Stark : And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?

Grand Maester Pycelle : What else could it be?

Eddard Stark : Poison.

Grand Maester Pycelle : A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...

Eddard Stark : I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.

Grand Maester Pycelle : Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?

Eddard Stark : Everybody knows that.

Grand Maester Pycelle : Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know.

Eddard Stark : I've taken enough of your time.

Grand Maester Pycelle : No trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor...

Eddard Stark : Thank you. I'll find my own way out.

Arya Stark : Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.

Eddard Stark : It's a hard fall down these steps.

Arya Stark : Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.

Eddard Stark : Cats? Syrio says.

Arya Stark : He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.

Eddard Stark : He's right about that.

Arya Stark : Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?

Eddard Stark : He needs to get his strength back first.

Arya Stark : He wants to be a knight of the King's Guard. He can't be one now, can he?

Eddard Stark : No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.

Arya Stark : Can I be Lord of a holdfast?

Eddard Stark : You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.

Arya Stark : No. That's not me.

Sam Tarly : Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well.

Jon Snow : Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.

Sam Tarly : No, that's all right. I'm fine.

Jon Snow : You're not. You're freezing.

Sam Tarly : I don't like high places.

Jon Snow : You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?

Sam Tarly : On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. "You're almost a man now," he said, "but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not," he said, "then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more." Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?

Jon Snow : Yes, he is.

Sam Tarly : I'm not going to get any better, you know?

Jon Snow : Well. You can't get any worse.

Petyr Baelish : I hear you're reading a boring book.

Eddard Stark : Pycelle talks too much.

Petyr Baelish : He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.

Eddard Stark : Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?

Petyr Baelish : I promised Cat that I'd help you.

Eddard Stark : Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.

Petyr Baelish : A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?

Eddard Stark : Varys or the Queen?

Petyr Baelish : No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?

Eddard Stark : Yes.

Petyr Baelish : The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel.

Petyr Baelish : I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.

Eddard Stark : Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.

Petyr Baelish : Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.

Jory Cassel : Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!

Hugh Of Vale : As you can see, I'm busy.

Jory Cassel : I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard.

Hugh Of Vale : I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser...

Jory Cassel : No "ser." I'm not a knight.

Hugh Of Vale : I see. Well, it just so happens that I am.

Jory Cassel : He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see.

Eddard Stark : A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.

Jory Cassel : You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where.

Eddard Stark : Let them look.

Tobho Mott : The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage.

Eddard Stark : What did Lord Arryn want?

Tobho Mott : He always came to see the boy.

Eddard Stark : I'd like to see him as well.

Tobho Mott : As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad.

Eddard Stark : This is fine work.

Gendry Baratheon : It's not for sale.

Tobho Mott : Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet...

Gendry Baratheon : I made it for me.

Tobho Mott : Forgive him, my Lord.

Eddard Stark : There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?

Gendry Baratheon : He just asked me questions is all, my Lord.

Eddard Stark : What kind of questions?

Gendry Baratheon : About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother.

Eddard Stark : Your mother?

Gendry Baratheon : Who she was, what she looked like.

Eddard Stark : What did you tell him?

Gendry Baratheon : She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.

Eddard Stark : Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me.

Jory Cassel : Find anything?

Eddard Stark : King Robert's bastard son.

Jory Cassel : This is for the King from Lord Stark.

Jaime Lannister : Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.

Jory Cassel : Three? Four?

Jaime Lannister : He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.

Jory Cassel : Forgive me, my Lord...

Jaime Lannister : Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?

Jory Cassel : We've met before, you know.

Jaime Lannister : Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.

Jory Cassel : The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.

Jaime Lannister : That's where you got your scar?

Jory Cassel : Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.

Jaime Lannister : Vicious sons of whores.

Jory Cassel : They like their bloodshed.

Jaime Lannister : They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?

Jory Cassel : With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.

Jaime Lannister : I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.

Jory Cassel : Theon? He's a good lad.

Jaime Lannister : I doubt it.

Robert Baratheon : I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.

Jory Cassel : Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.

Jaime Lannister : I don't serve Lord Stark.

Grenn : Where have you been?

Jon Snow : Watch duty. With Sam.

Pyp : Prince Porkchop. Where is he?

Jon Snow : He wasn't hungry.

Pyp : Impossible!

Jon Snow : That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.

Rast : You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.

Jon Snow : No one touches Sam.

Alliser Thorne : What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there.

Grenn : Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield.

Alliser Thorne : You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?

Viserys Targaryen : You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!

Doreah : Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked.

Daenerys Targaryen : Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us.

Irri : Yes, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : Why did you hit her?!

Viserys Targaryen : How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.

Daenerys Targaryen : I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.

Viserys Targaryen : What's this?

Daenerys Targaryen : It's a gift. I had it made for you.

Viserys Targaryen : Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?

Daenerys Targaryen : Please.

Viserys Targaryen : This stinks of manure. All of it.

Daenerys Targaryen : Stop - stop it.

Viserys Targaryen : You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair.

Daenerys Targaryen : You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.

Viserys Targaryen : You do not talk back to me!

Viserys Targaryen : You are a horselordo s slut. And now you've woken the dragon...

Daenerys Targaryen : I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.

Sam Tarly : I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.

Jon Snow : I wouldn't doubt it.

Sam Tarly : Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?

Jon Snow : Sally on the side?

Sam Tarly : It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd.

Jon Snow : I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.

Sam Tarly : Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.

Jon Snow : As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.

Sam Tarly : I find that hard to believe.

Jon Snow : I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but...

Sam Tarly : You didn't know where to put it?

Jon Snow : I know where to put it.

Sam Tarly : Was she... Old and ugly?

Jon Snow : Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.

Sam Tarly : What color hair?

Jon Snow : Red.

Sam Tarly : I like red hair. And her... Her...

Jon Snow : You don't want to know.

Sam Tarly : That good?

Jon Snow : Better.

Sam Tarly : Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...

Jon Snow : What's my name?

Sam Tarly : Jon Snow?

Jon Snow : And why is my surname Snow?

Sam Tarly : Because... You're a bastard from the north.

Jon Snow : I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child.

Sam Tarly : So... You didn't know where to put it?

Alliser Thorne : Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys.

Sam Tarly : It is a bit nippy.

Alliser Thorne : A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?

Jon Snow : I build my own fires.

Alliser Thorne : That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies.

Daenerys Targaryen : I hit him. I hit the dragon.

Jorah Mormont : Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.

Daenerys Targaryen : He is still the true King.

Jorah Mormont : The truth now

Daenerys Targaryen : No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.

Jorah Mormont : The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play.

Daenerys Targaryen : What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?

Jorah Mormont : Home.

Daenerys Targaryen : I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.

Petyr Baelish : Lover's quarrel?

Sansa Stark : I'm sorry. Do I...?

Septa Mordane : Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known...

Petyr Baelish : An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.

Arya Stark : Why do they call you Littlefinger?

Sansa Stark : Arya!

Septa Mordane : Don't be rude!

Petyr Baelish : No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname.

Robert Baratheon : I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!

Sansa Stark : Gods, who is that?

Petyr Baelish : Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Houndo s older brother.

Sansa Stark : And his opponent?

Petyr Baelish : Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.

Robert Baratheon : Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!

Petyr Baelish : Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story.

Sansa Stark : I won't tell anyone. I promise.

Petyr Baelish : No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you.

Jory Cassel : My Lord, Her Grace the Queen.

Eddard Stark : Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : You're missing your tournament.

Eddard Stark : Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.

Cersei Lannister : I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us - the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?

Eddard Stark : She likes it here.

Cersei Lannister : The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her.

Eddard Stark : What are you doing here?

Cersei Lannister : I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?

Eddard Stark : The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.

Cersei Lannister : You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces.

Eddard Stark : If that's my job, then so be it.

Cersei Lannister : You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.

Eddard Stark : I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : As was I.

Marillion : Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!

Catelyn Stark : And to you.

Rodrick Cassel : Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly.

Marillion : Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?

Rodrick Cassel : I'd rather throw myself down a well.

Marillion : Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!

Masha Heddle : I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room.

Tyrion Lannister : My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room.

Masha Heddle : Truly, my lord, we have nothing.

Tyrion Lannister : Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?

Bronn : You can have my room.

Tyrion Lannister : There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.

Yoren : Aye, my Lord.

Marillion : My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!

Tyrion Lannister : Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.

Masha Heddle : Lady Stark.

Catelyn Stark : I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?

Knight Of House Whent : It is, my Lady.

Catelyn Stark : And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?

Knight Of House Whent : She is.

Catelyn Stark : The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.

Knight Of House Bracken : Our lord is honored by his trust.

Tyrion Lannister : I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this.

Catelyn Stark : Knight of House Frey

Catelyn Stark : This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice.

Eddard Stark : Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?

Barristan Selmy : No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.

Eddard Stark : He'd never worn this armor before.

Barristan Selmy : Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.

Eddard Stark : Who determines the draw?

Barristan Selmy : All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.

Eddard Stark : Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters.

Barristan Selmy : Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.

Eddard Stark : I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her.

Barristan Selmy : You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.

Eddard Stark : My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.

Barristan Selmy : He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.

Eddard Stark : And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?

Barristan Selmy : Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.

Eddard Stark : Yes. That will never happen.

Barristan Selmy : Robert tends to do what he wants.

Eddard Stark : If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.

Lancel Lannister : It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go.

Robert Baratheon : Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.

Eddard Stark : You're too fat for your armor.

Robert Baratheon : Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?

Robert Baratheon : Oh, it's funny, is it?

Lancel Lannister : No, Your Grace.

Robert Baratheon : No? You don't like the Hando s joke?

Eddard Stark : You're torturing the poor boy.

Robert Baratheon : You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!

Eddard Stark : The breastplate stretcher?

Robert Baratheon : How long before he figures it out?

Eddard Stark : Maybe you should have one invented.

Robert Baratheon : All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance.

Eddard Stark : You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.

Robert Baratheon : Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!

Eddard Stark : And who's going to hit you back?

Robert Baratheon : Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!

Eddard Stark : There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.

Robert Baratheon : Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?

Eddard Stark : Aye.

Robert Baratheon : Drink.

Eddard Stark : I'm not thirsty.

Robert Baratheon : Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.

Eddard Stark : Your squire... A Lannister boy?

Robert Baratheon : Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. "Cersei Lannister will make a good match", he told me. "You'll need her father on your side." I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood.

Eddard Stark : Robert?

Robert Baratheon : What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!

Eddard Stark : Where's Arya

Sansa Stark : At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.

Sansa Stark : Thank you, Ser Loras.

Sansa Stark : Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.

Eddard Stark : Hey.

Sansa Stark : I can't watch.

Petyr Baelish : 100 gold dragons on the Mountain.

Renly Baratheon : I'll take that bet.

Petyr Baelish : Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?

Renly Baratheon : Or you could even buy a friend.

Sansa Stark : He's going to die.

Eddard Stark : Ser Loras rides well.

Renly Baratheon : Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend.

Petyr Baelish : And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?

Petyr Baelish : Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really.

Sansa Stark : Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.

Petyr Baelish : No honor but quite a bit of gold.

Robert Baratheon : Stop this madness in the name of your King!

Loras Tyrell : I owe you my life, Ser.

Sandor Clegane : I'm no Ser.

Catelyn Stark : Remove his hood.

Marillion : On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold.

Tyrion Lannister : This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.

Catelyn Stark : I did... often and loudly.

Tyrion Lannister : Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Wordo s probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?

Catelyn Stark : And why would I do that?

Tyrion Lannister : Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.

Catelyn Stark : Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?

Catelyn Stark : Five years ago.

Tyrion Lannister : She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here.

Catelyn Stark : I am not a murderer, Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister : Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!

Catelyn Stark : The dagger found

Tyrion Lannister : What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?

Rodrik Cassel : Should I gag him?

Tyrion Lannister : Why? Am I starting to make sense?

Rodrik Cassel : My Lady, this way.

Tyrion Lannister : Untie me. If I die, what's the point?

Catelyn Stark : Rodrik?

Rodrik Cassel : I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself.

Bronn : Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, I'm willing if she is.

Maester Luwin : Bran...

Bran Stark : The Iron Islands. Sigil - a Kraken. Words - "We do not sow".

Maester Luwin : Lords?

Bran Stark : The Greyjoys.

Theon Greyjoy : Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking.

Maester Luwin : And failed rebellions.

Bran Stark : Sigil - a stag. - A crowned stag now that Robert's King.

Maester Luwin : Good.

Bran Stark : Words - "Ours is the fury". Lords - the Baratheons.

Bran Stark : The Westerlands - sigil - a lion.

Maester Luwin : Hmm...

Bran Stark : Words - "A Lannister always pays his debts."

Maester Luwin : No. A common saying, but not their official motto.

Bran Stark : Lords - the Lannisters.

Maester Luwin : We're still on their words.

Bran Stark : I don't know them.

Maester Luwin : You do know them. Think.

Bran Stark : Unbowed, unbent, unbroken".

Maester Luwin : That's House Martell.

Bran Stark : Righteous in wrath".

Maester Luwin : House Hornwood.

Bran Stark : Family, duty, honor".

Maester Luwin : Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?

Bran Stark : Family, duty, honor"... Is that the right order?

Maester Luwin : You know it is.

Bran Stark : Family comes first?

Maester Luwin : Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.

Bran Stark : How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?

Maester Luwin : Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.

Bran Stark : And then she left!

Maester Luwin : When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely.

Bran Stark : Why did she leave?

Maester Luwin : I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon.

Bran Stark : Do you know where she is now? Today?

Maester Luwin : No, I don't.

Bran Stark : Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?

Maester Luwin : Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.

Bran Stark : I'll never shoot another arrow.

Maester Luwin : And where is that written?

Bran Stark : You need legs to work a bow.

Maester Luwin : Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback.

Bran Stark : Really?

Maester Luwin : Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?

Theon Greyjoy : Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.

Ros : I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.

Theon Greyjoy : Important enough for the likes of you.

Ros : You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know.

Theon Greyjoy : Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.

Ros : Jealous?

Theon Greyjoy : Why should I be jealous?

Theon Greyjoy : Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.

Ros : Might surprise you.

Theon Greyjoy : Hmm?

Ros : He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.

Theon Greyjoy : Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.

Ros : You are jealous.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters.

Ros : And what about the Starks?

Theon Greyjoy : I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.

Ros : A "ward"�, that's a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again.

Theon Greyjoy : My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.

Ros : You're a very serious boy.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm not a boy.

Ros : Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock.

Theon Greyjoy : I don't want to pay for it.

Ros : Then get yourself a wife.

Arya Stark : Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.

Varys : How is your son, my Lord?

Eddard Stark : He'll never walk again.

Varys : But his mind is sound?

Eddard Stark : So they say.

Varys : A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?

Varys : If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him.

Eddard Stark : I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?

Varys : I didn't trust you.

Eddard Stark : So why do you trust me now?

Varys : The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.

Eddard Stark : What sort of doom does the King face?

Varys : The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace.

Eddard Stark : Who gave it to him?

Varys : Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn.

Eddard Stark : The squire, Ser Hugh?

Varys : Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.

Eddard Stark : If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?

Varys : Someone who could afford it.

Eddard Stark : Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?

Varys : He started asking questions.

Varys : He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.

Illyrio Mopatis : And when he knows the truth, what will he do?

Varys : The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend.

Illyrio Mopatis : What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?

Varys : This Hand is not the other.

Illyrio Mopatis : We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.

Varys : Delay," you say. "Move fast, " I reply. This is no longer a game for two players.

Illyrio Mopatis : It never was.

Varys : The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.

Petyr Baelish : You do move quietly.

Varys : We all have our qualities.

Petyr Baelish : You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.

Varys : I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.

Petyr Baelish : Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.

Varys : Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.

Petyr Baelish : I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important.

Varys : Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?

Petyr Baelish : All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.

Varys : And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.

Petyr Baelish : Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws.

Varys : Strictly speaking.

Petyr Baelish : Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered.

Varys : Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?

Petyr Baelish : Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?

Varys : Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.

Petyr Baelish : Saw me with your own eyes?

Varys : Eyes I own.

Petyr Baelish : Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.

Varys : Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...

Petyr Baelish : One shudders at the thought.

Varys : Oh.

Petyr Baelish : But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.

Varys : Have you?

Petyr Baelish : Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.

Varys : Was that you under the bed?

Petyr Baelish : And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friendo s sympathies. To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm.

Varys : Oh, please.

Petyr Baelish : To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --

Renly Baratheon : What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming.

Petyr Baelish : To a small council meeting?

Varys : Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?

Guard : Off with you. No begging.

Arya Stark : I'm not a beggar. I live here.

Guard : D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?

Arya Stark : I want to see my father.

Guard : I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me.

Guard : You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends.

Arya Stark : My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?

Eddard Stark : You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.

Arya Stark : They said they were going to kill you.

Eddard Stark : Who did?

Arya Stark : I didn't see them, but I think one was fat.

Eddard Stark : Oh, Arya.

Arya Stark : I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.

Eddard Stark : Where did you hear this?

Arya Stark : In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls.

Eddard Stark : What were you doing in the dungeons?

Arya Stark : Chasing a cat.

Jory Cassel : Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent.

Eddard Stark : Your name, friend?

Yoren : Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look.

Arya Stark : I'm a girl!

Eddard Stark : Did Benjen send you?

Yoren : No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.

Eddard Stark : Ah, we'll find recruits for you.

Yoren : Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow.

Eddard Stark : Know what?

Yoren : Best said in private, my Lord.

Eddard Stark : Go on. We'll talk more later.

Eddard Stark : Jory, take her safely to her room.

Jory Cassel : Come along, my Lady. You heard your father.

Arya Stark : How many guards does my father have?

Jory Cassel : Here in King's Landing? Fifty.

Arya Stark : You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?

Jory Cassel : No fear on that count, little Lady.

Eddard Stark : Well?

Yoren : It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp.

Vardis Egen : You're far from home, Lady Stark.

Catelyn Stark : To whom do I speak?

Vardis Egen : Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?

Catelyn Stark : There was no time to send word.

Vardis Egen : May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?

Catelyn Stark : That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.

Vardis Egen : He doesn't look like a prisoner.

Catelyn Stark : My sister will decide what he looks like.

Vardis Egen : Yes, my Lady. She will at that.

Tyrion Lannister : The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.

Bronn : Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.

Tyrion Lannister : I like you.

Steward : Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.

Eddard Stark : I need to see the King first -- alone.

Steward : The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you.

Eddard Stark : Is it about my wife?

Steward : No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.

Robert Baratheon : The whore is pregnant.

Eddard Stark : You're speaking of murdering a child.

Robert Baratheon : I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead.

Eddard Stark : You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.

Robert Baratheon : Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!

Eddard Stark : Then we're no better than the Mad King.

Robert Baratheon : Careful, Ned. Careful now.

Eddard Stark : You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?

Varys : No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child.

Eddard Stark : Based on whose information?

Varys : Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.

Eddard Stark : Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?

Petyr Baelish : Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.

Eddard Stark : He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?

Robert Baratheon : And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army. What then?

Eddard Stark : The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.

Robert Baratheon : Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.

Varys : I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.

Grand Maester Pycelle : I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?

Renly Baratheon : We should have had them both killed years ago.

Petyr Baelish : When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it.

Eddard Stark : I followed you into war - twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.

Robert Baratheon : She dies.

Eddard Stark : I will have no part in it.

Robert Baratheon : You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will.

Eddard Stark : And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.

Robert Baratheon : Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!

Eddard Stark : I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.

Jory Cassel : Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you.

Petyr Baelish : His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word "treason" was mentioned.

Eddard Stark : What can I do for you?

Petyr Baelish : When do you return to Winterfell?

Eddard Stark : Why? What do you care?

Petyr Baelish : If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you.

Eddard Stark : I don't have the time.

Petyr Baelish : It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.

Eddard Stark : Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?

Jory Cassel : Heward and Wyl.

Eddard Stark : Find them and meet me at the stables.

Lysa Arryn : You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, "the seed is strong." He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.

Catelyn Stark : Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-

Lysa Arryn : To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!

Robin Arryn : Mommy? Is that the bad man?

Lysa Arryn : It is.

Robin Arryn : He's little.

Lysa Arryn : He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!

Tyrion Lannister : Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.

Lysa Arryn : You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.

Tyrion Lannister : If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do.

Robin Arryn : You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!

Lysa Arryn : Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby.

Robin Arryn : Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.

Lysa Arryn : Perhaps you will, my little love.

Catelyn Stark : This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.

Lysa Arryn : Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord.

Mord : You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!

Loras Tyrell : Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.

Renly Baratheon : Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man.

Loras Tyrell : You're jealous.

Renly Baratheon : Are you sure this won't hurt?

Loras Tyrell : Only if I slip.

Renly Baratheon : And you prefer me like this?

Loras Tyrell : Mhmm.

Renly Baratheon : If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.

Loras Tyrell : I want you.

Renly Baratheon : My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?

Loras Tyrell : Hold still.

Renly Baratheon : All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood.

Loras Tyrell : You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the m?�l??e.

Renly Baratheon : His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!

Loras Tyrell : He shouldn't have entered the m?�l??e if he didn't know how to fight.

Renly Baratheon : Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.

Loras Tyrell : It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick.

Renly Baratheon : I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you.

Loras Tyrell : Yes well, I guess we'll never know.

Renly Baratheon : Everywhere?

Loras Tyrell : Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?

Renly Baratheon : It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches.

Loras Tyrell : It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.

Renly Baratheon : He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money.

Loras Tyrell : I have an outrageous amount of money.

Renly Baratheon : Not as much as the Lannisters.

Loras Tyrell : But a lot more than you.

Renly Baratheon : Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King.

Loras Tyrell : Hmm... How did that ever happen?

Renly Baratheon : Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.

Loras Tyrell : Do you know who should be King?

Renly Baratheon : Be serious.

Loras Tyrell : I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you.

Renly Baratheon : I'm fourth in line.

Loras Tyrell : And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.

Renly Baratheon : Stannis?

Loras Tyrell : Stannis has the personality of a lobster.

Renly Baratheon : He's still my older brother.

Renly Baratheon : What are you doing?!

Loras Tyrell : Look at it.

Renly Baratheon : You cut me!

Loras Tyrell : It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you.

Loras Tyrell : You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King.

Cersei Lannister : I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.

Robert Baratheon : I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.

Cersei Lannister : Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.

Robert Baratheon : I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.

Cersei Lannister : No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?

Robert Baratheon : I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them.

Cersei Lannister : The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.

Robert Baratheon : It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out.

Cersei Lannister : Is my father wrong?

Robert Baratheon : Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all.

Cersei Lannister : We still outnumber them.

Robert Baratheon : Which is the bigger number -- five or one?

Cersei Lannister : Five.

Robert Baratheon : Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.

Cersei Lannister : What do you want?

Robert Baratheon : We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.

Cersei Lannister : Our marriage.

Robert Baratheon : Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?

Cersei Lannister : Every day.

Robert Baratheon : How long can hate hold a thing together?

Cersei Lannister : Well, seventeen years is quite a long time.

Robert Baratheon : Yes, it is.

Cersei Lannister : Yes, it tis. What was she like?

Robert Baratheon : You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?

Cersei Lannister : At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.

Robert Baratheon : So why now?

Cersei Lannister : What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?

Robert Baratheon : You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.

Cersei Lannister : I felt something for you once, you know?

Robert Baratheon : I know.

Cersei Lannister : Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?

Robert Baratheon : No. Does that make you feel better or worse?

Cersei Lannister : It doesn't make me feel anything.

Mhaegen : She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair.

Mhaegen : Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is.

Eddard Stark : I will.

Mhaegen : And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me.

Eddard Stark : When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?

Mhaegen : He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy.

Eddard Stark : She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.

Petyr Baelish : Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink.

Eddard Stark : What do you know of King Robert's bastards?

Petyr Baelish : Well, he has more than you, for a start.

Eddard Stark : How many?

Petyr Baelish : Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.

Eddard Stark : And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?

Petyr Baelish : He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.

Eddard Stark : Come.

Eddard Stark : Jory!

Jory Cassel : My Lord.

Jaime Lannister : Such a small pack of wolves.

Jory Cassel : Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!

Jaime Lannister : Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.

Petyr Baelish : What's the meaning of this, Lannister?

Jaime Lannister : Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.

Eddard Stark : I remember him well.

Jaime Lannister : It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?

Eddard Stark : He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.

Petyr Baelish : My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!

Jaime Lannister : Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand.

Jory Cassel : If you threaten my Lord again...

Jaime Lannister : Threaten? As in, "I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of"�?

Eddard Stark : You kill me, your brother's a dead man.

Jaime Lannister : You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!

Jaime Lannister : My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back.

Eddard Stark : Your pardon, your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : Do you know what your wife has done?

Eddard Stark : She did nothing I did not command.

Robert Baratheon : Who'd have thought she had it in her?

Cersei Lannister : By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?

Eddard Stark : I am the King's Hand -

Cersei Lannister : You were the King's Hand!

Eddard Stark : trying to keep the peace -

Cersei Lannister : You shall now be held accountable.

Robert Baratheon : Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime.

Eddard Stark : He butchered my men.

Cersei Lannister : Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.

Robert Baratheon : Quiet, woman.

Eddard Stark : Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.

Cersei Lannister : I took you for a king.

Robert Baratheon : Hold your tongue.

Cersei Lannister : He's attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.

Cersei Lannister : I shall wear this like a badge of honor.

Robert Baratheon : Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again.

Robert Baratheon : See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not. That was not kingly.

Eddard Stark : If we don't act. there will be a war.

Robert Baratheon : So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing. She's had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.

Eddard Stark : And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?

Robert Baratheon : I'm half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father. I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. I don't want to know. This is what matters - I can't rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats, so enough!

Eddard Stark : As you command your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.

Robert Baratheon : Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I'm the king, I get what I want. I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true. You were the brother I chose. We'll talk when I return from the hunt.

Eddard Stark : The hunt?

Robert Baratheon : Killing things clears my head. You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away. You'll hate it more than I do.

Eddard Stark : The Targaryen girl -

Robert Baratheon : Seven hells! Don't start with her again! The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I'll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister.

Irri : Khaleesi?

Irri : Oh, Khaleesi!

Daenerys Targaryen : You're hurt.

Robb Stark : Not too fast.

Bran Stark : Come on, Dancer.

Theon Greyjoy : When are you gonna tell him?

Robb Stark : Not now.

Theon Greyjoy : Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.

Robb Stark : You're talking about war.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm talking about justice.

Robb Stark : Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.

Theon Greyjoy : A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -

Robb Stark : You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!

Theon Greyjoy : You're not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They've already started the war. It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.

Robb Stark : And it's not your duty, because it's not your House.

Robb Stark : Where's Bran?

Theon Greyjoy : I don't know. It's not my House.

Bran Stark : Robb?

Osha : All alone in the deep dark woods.

Bran Stark : I'm not alone, my brother is with me.

Wildling : I don't see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?

Osha : Oh, that's a pretty pin. Silver.

Wildling : We'll take the pin. And the horse. Get down. Be quick about it.

Bran Stark : I can't. The saddle, the straps.

Wildling : What's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?

Bran Stark : I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!

Wildling : Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.

Osha : the boy's worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark's own blood. Think what Mance would give us.

Wildling : Piss on Mance rayder and piss on the North. We're going as far south as south goes. There ain't no white walkers down in Dorne.

Robb Stark : Drop the knife. Let him go and I'll let you live.

Bran Stark : Robb!

Wildling : Shut up! Drop the blade!

Bran Stark : No, don't.

Wildling : Do it.

Robb Stark : Are you all right?

Bran Stark : Yes, it doesn't hurt.

Theon Greyjoy : Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy. Well done.

Robb Stark : Have you lost your mind? What if you'd missed?

Theon Greyjoy : He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.

Robb Stark : You don't have the right -

Theon Greyjoy : To what, to save your brother's life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it.

Robb Stark : What about her?

Osha : Give me my life, my lord, and I'm yours.

Robb Stark : We'll keep her alive.

Tyrion Lannister : Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!

Mord : Dwarf man making noise!

Tyrion Lannister : How would you like to be rich?

Mord : Dwarf man still making noise.

Tyrion Lannister : My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I'm prepared to give you lots of gold.

Mord : No gold!

Tyrion Lannister : Well, I don't have it here.

Mord : No gold! Fuck off.

Arya Stark : I don't want to practice today.

Syrio Forel : No?

Arya Stark : They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don't care about stupid wooden swords.

Syrio Forel : You are troubled.

Arya Stark : Yes -

Syrio Forel : Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens.

Arya Stark : I don't like dolls and k -

Syrio Forel : You're not here. You're with your trouble. If you're with your trouble when fighting happens.

Syrio Forel : More trouble for you. Just so. How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?

Syrio Forel : The old and the new.

Syrio Forel : There is only one god. And his name is death. And there is only one thing we say to death - "Not today."�

Viserys Targaryen : She has to eat a whole heart? I hope that wasn't my horse.

Jorah Mormont : She's doing well.

Viserys Targaryen : She'll never keep it down.

Viserys Targaryen : Tell me what she is saying.

Jorah Mormont : The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of the hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him. and their wives will weep tears of blood."�

Jorah Mormont : She's going to have a boy.

Viserys Targaryen : He won't be a real Targaryen. He won't be a true dragon.

Jorah Mormont : The stallion who mounts the world."� The stallion, is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd.

Daenerys Targaryen : A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego!

Viserys Targaryen : They love her.

Jorah Mormont : She truly is a queen today.

Jorah Mormont : Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.

Viserys Targaryen : It's not my law.

Jorah Mormont : They don't belong to you.

Viserys Targaryen : Whatever is hers is also mine.

Jorah Mormont : Once, perhaps.

Viserys Targaryen : If I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship. Two eggs - a ship and an army.

Jorah Mormont : And you have all three.

Viserys Targaryen : I need a large army. I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it. How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don't think I know what you want? I don't care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go.

Jorah Mormont : You can go, but you can't have the eggs.

Viserys Targaryen : You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?

Jorah Mormont : It means everything to me.

Viserys Targaryen : And yet here you stand?

Jorah Mormont : And here I stand.

Tyrion Lannister : Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!

Mord : Noise again!

Tyrion Lannister : About the gold -

Tyrion Lannister : Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession. is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.

Mord : Where?

Tyrion Lannister : Where? I don't know where, but when they free me -

Mord : You want free? Go be free.

Tyrion Lannister : Have you ever heard the phrase "Rich as a Lannister"�? Of course you have. You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, "a Lannister always pays his debts."� If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.

Mord : What message?

Tyrion Lannister : Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.

Lysa Arryn : You wish to confess your crimes?

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, my lady. I do, my lady.

Lysa Arryn : Skycells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man.

Tyrion Lannister : Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and. I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -

Lysa Arryn : Silence!

Robin Arryn : What happened next?!

Lysa Arryn : What do you think you're doing?

Tyrion Lannister : Confessing my crimes.

Catelyn Stark : Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that.

Lysa Arryn : You've had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor.

Tyrion Lannister : Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's Justice? I'm accused and demand a trial.

Lysa Arryn : If you're tried and found guilty, then by the king's own laws you will pay with your life.

Tyrion Lannister : I understand the law.

Lysa Arryn : We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door.

Lysa Arryn : You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other.

Tyrion Lannister : No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.

Lysa Arryn : You have that right.

Knight : My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion.

Knight : The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death.

Knight : I'll fight for you, my Lady.

Knight : It'll be my honor.

Knight : The honor should be mine.

Robin Arryn : Make the bad man fly!

Lysa Arryn : Ser Vardis. You're quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband?

Ser Vardis : With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.

Tyrion Lannister : Agreed.

Lysa Arryn : You demanded a trial by combat.

Tyrion Lannister : Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.

Ser Vardis : My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.

Tyrion Lannister : I wouldn't be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.

Lysa Arryn : The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.

Tyrion Lannister : Send a raven for him, I'm happy to wait.

Lysa Arryn : The trial will be today.

Tyrion Lannister : Do I have a volunteer?

Tyrion Lannister : Anyone?... Anyone?

Lysa Arryn : I think that we can assume that no one is willing -

Bronn : I'll stand for the dwarf.

Lancel Lannister : More wine, your Grace?

Robert Baratheon : Oh, what was I saying?

Renly Baratheon : A simpler time.

Robert Baratheon : It was! It was. You're too young to remember. Wasn't it, Selmy?

Barriston : It was, your Grace.

Robert Baratheon : The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today.

Renly Baratheon : Sounds exhilarating.

Robert Baratheon : Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?

Renly Baratheon : Once, I think.

Robert Baratheon : You think? I think you'd remember. Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it "making the eight."�

Renly Baratheon : Those were some lucky girls.

Robert Baratheon : You ever make the eight, Barristan?

Barristan Selmy : I don't believe so, your Grace.

Robert Baratheon : Those were the days!

Renly Baratheon : What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?

Robert Baratheon : Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King.

Renly Baratheon : I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and "make the eight."�

Man : They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took 'em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire.

Grand Maester Pycelle : Brigands, most likely.

Man : They weren't thieves, they didn't steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace.

Grand Maester Pycelle : It's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the king. The king is hunting.

Petyr Baelish : Fish. The sigil of House Tully. Isn't that your wife's House - Tully - my Lord Hand?

Eddard Stark : These men, were they flying a sigil? . A banner.

Man : None, your. Hand. The one who was leading them. Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.

Petyr Baelish : That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.

Eddard Stark : You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.

Grand Maester Pycelle : Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.

Petyr Baelish : I've heard him called "Tywin Lannister's mad dog."� I'm sure you have as well. Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?

Grand Maester Pycelle : If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king's protection, it would be -

Petyr Baelish : It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.

Grand Maester Pycelle : Wel.

Eddard Stark : I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion.

Eddard Stark : You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.

Beric Dondarrion : As you command.

Eddard Stark : In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.

Grand Maester Pycelle : My lord. This. This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert's return.

Eddard Stark : Grand Maester Pycelle.

Grand Maester Pycelle : My Lord.

Eddard Stark : Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm.

Petyr Baelish : A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers.

Eddard Stark : Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?

Robin Arryn : Is it over?

Lysa Arryn : You don't fight with honor!

Bronn : No. He did.

Robin Arryn : Can I make the little man fly now?

Tyrion Lannister : Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.

Tyrion Lannister : A Lannister always pays his debts.

Mordane : You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.

Sansa Stark : Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the south.

Mordane : It's important to remember where you come from. I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.

Sansa Stark : My mother isn't from the North.

Mordane : I'm aware of that.

Sansa Stark : Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?

Mordane : Yes. I have hair.

Sansa Stark : I've never seen it.

Mordane : Would you like to?

Sansa Stark : No. Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?

Mordane : I come from a very small village in -

Sansa Stark : Oh, wait. I just realized. I don't care.

Mordane : Sansa -

Sansa Stark : Septa.

Mordane : Now you are being rude.

Mordane : My prince.

Sansa Stark : My prince.

Joffrey Lannister : My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?

Sansa Stark : It's beautiful. Like the one your mother wears.

Joffrey Lannister : You'll be queen one day, it's only fitting that you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?

Sansa Stark : There's nothing to forgive.

Joffrey Lannister : You're my lady. One day we'll be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North, to the salt shore of the south. And you will be queen over all of them. I'll never disrespect you again. I'll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You're my lady now, from this day, until my last day.

Theon Greyjoy : Stop! Stop! What are you doing?!

Ros : Going to King's Landing.

Theon Greyjoy : In a turnip cart?

Ros : I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.

Theon Greyjoy : And you can afford that?

Ros : Some of my friends are more generous than others.

Theon Greyjoy : There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.

Ros : I'll have lots of company.

Theon Greyjoy : Yes, you'll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.

Ros : And what will happen to me if I stay here? Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands?

Theon Greyjoy : Don't be a fool.

Ros : I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing. Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back, there's nothing more for me here. Let's go, Steffon.

Theon Greyjoy : Let me see it one more time?

Ros : See what?

Theon Greyjoy : I'm going to miss you!

Ros : I know.

Eddard Stark : I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.

Sansa Stark : What?!

Eddard Stark : Listen -

Sansa Stark : What about Joffrey?

Arya Stark : Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you're sending us home?

Eddard Stark : What? No.

Sansa Stark : Please, Father. Please don't.

Arya Stark : You can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio. I'm finally getting good.

Eddard Stark : This isn't a punishment. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.

Arya Stark : Can't we take Syrio back with us?

Sansa Stark : Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go. I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I'm meant to be his queen and have his babies.

Arya Stark : Seven hells.

Eddard Stark : When you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone who's brave and gentle and strong -

Sansa Stark : I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him! He'll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.

Arya Stark : The lion's not his sigil, idiot. He's a stag, like his father.

Sansa Stark : He is not. He's nothing like that old drunk king.

Eddard Stark : Go on, girls. Get your septa and start packing your things.

Sansa Stark : Wait!

Arya Stark : Come on!

Sansa Stark : It's not fair!

Eddard Stark : Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair."� "Axel Baratheon, black of hair."� "Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair."� "Steffon Baratheon, black of hair."� "Robert Baratheon, black of hair."� "Joffrey Baratheon. golden-haired."�

Viserys Targaryen : Daenerys! Where's my sister?

Daenerys Targaryen : Stop him.

Viserys Targaryen : Where is she? I'm here for the feast. The whore's feast.

Jorah Mormont : Come.

Viserys Targaryen : Get your hands off me! No one touches the dragon!

Viserys Targaryen : Khal Drogo! I'm here for the feast.

Jorah Mormont : Khal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there.

Viserys Targaryen : That is no place for a king.

Khal Drogo : You are no king.

Viserys Targaryen : Keep away from me!

Daenerys Targaryen : Viserys, please.

Viserys Targaryen : There she is.

Jorah Mormont : Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.

Viserys Targaryen : They can't kill us. They can't shed blood in their sacred city. But I can. I want what I came for. I want the crown he promised me. He bought you. But he never paid for you.

Viserys Targaryen : Tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back. He can keep the baby. I'll cut it out and leave it for him.

Viserys Targaryen : What's he saying?

Daenerys Targaryen : He says yes. You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold.

Viserys Targaryen : That was all I wanted. W-what was promised.

Viserys Targaryen : No! You cannot touch me! I am the dragon! I am the dragon! I want my crown! Ahh!

Jorah Mormont : Look away Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : No.

Viserys Targaryen : No. Dany! Dany, tell them, make them! You can't!

Viserys Targaryen : Dany please!

Khal Drogo : A crown for a king.

Jorah Mormont : Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.

Jaime Lannister : Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain

Tywin Lannister : Attacking him was stupid.

Tywin Lannister : Lannisters don't act like fools.

Jaime Lannister : Catelyn Stark took my brother.

Tywin Lannister : Why is he still alive?

Jaime Lannister : Tyrion?

Tywin Lannister : Ned Stark.

Jaime Lannister : One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him.

Jaime Lannister : It wouldn't have been clean.

Tywin Lannister : Clean...

Tywin Lannister : You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.

Jaime Lannister : I could care less what anyone thinks of me.

Tywin Lannister : Now that's what you want people to think of you.

Jaime Lannister : It's the truth.

Tywin Lannister : When you hear them whispering "Kingslayer" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?

Jaime Lannister : Of course it bothers me.

Tywin Lannister : The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.

Jaime Lannister : I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.

Tywin Lannister : He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us.

Jaime Lannister : So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of..

Tywin Lannister : No, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!

Tywin Lannister : Hmm.

Cersei Lannister : You're in pain.

Eddard Stark : I've had worse, my lady.

Cersei Lannister : Perhaps it's time to go home.

Eddard Stark : The South doesn't seem to agree with you.

Eddard Stark : I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.

Cersei Lannister : Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?

Eddard Stark : Has he done this before?

Cersei Lannister : Jaime would have killed him.

Cersei Lannister : My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.

Eddard Stark : Your brother Or your lover?

Cersei Lannister : The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.

Cersei Lannister : Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.

Eddard Stark : My son saw you with him.

Cersei Lannister : Do you love your children?

Eddard Stark : With all my heart.

Cersei Lannister : No more than I love mine.

Eddard Stark : And they are all Jaime's.

Cersei Lannister : Thank the Gods.

Eddard Stark : You've always hated him.

Cersei Lannister : Hated him? I worshiped him.

Eddard Stark : When the King returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.

Cersei Lannister : And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself.

Eddard Stark : I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them.

Cersei Lannister : Oh, but it was.

Ros : Come here.

Petyr Baelish : No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you-- wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?

Ros : Yes, My Lord.

Petyr Baelish : Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman.

Ros : Why don't you join us, My Lord?

Petyr Baelish : I'm saving myself for another.

Ros : What she doesn't know won't hurt her.

Petyr Baelish : A stupid saying.

Ros : She must be very beautiful.

Petyr Baelish : No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though.

Ros : I do believe my lordo s in love.

Petyr Baelish : For many years. Most of my life really.

Ros : Is she still married to him?

Petyr Baelish : Oh no. He got himself killed before the wedding.

Ros : And what do you want?

Petyr Baelish : Oh, everything, my dear. Everything there is.

Theon Greyjoy : You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?

Osha : Where is it you come from?

Theon Greyjoy : The Iron Islands.

Osha : They far away?

Theon Greyjoy : You've never heard of the Iron Islands?

Osha : Trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither.

Theon Greyjoy : Trust me, My Lord. You're not living in the wilderness anymore.

Osha : And what's that?

Theon Greyjoy : Lord.

Osha : Why?

Theon Greyjoy : Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.

Osha : What's that got to do with you? If your father's lord, how can you be lord too?

Theon Greyjoy : I will be lord after my father.

Osha : So you're not lord now?

Theon Greyjoy : No, you...You having a go at me? Is that it?

Osha : I just don't understand how you Southerners do things.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm not a Southerner.

Osha : You're from South of the wall. That makes you a Southerner to me.

Theon Greyjoy : You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?

Osha : Couldn't say, My Lord. Don't know what "impunent" means.

Theon Greyjoy : Impudent. It means rude. Disrespectful.

Maester Luwin : Theon Greyjoy! The lady is our guest.

Theon Greyjoy : I thought she was our prisoner.

Maester Luwin : Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?

Maester Luwin : Chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.

Osha : I'm used to worse than him.

Osha : I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.

Maester Luwin : Why did you come here?

Osha : Didn't mean to come here. Meant to get much further South than this.

Maester Luwin : Why? What are you afraid of?

Osha : There's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.

Maester Luwin : Owls and Shadowcats and...

Osha : I'm not talking about Owls and Shadowcats.

Maester Luwin : The "things" you speak of-- they've been gone for thousands of years.

Osha : They wasn't gone, old man. They was sleeping.

Sam Tarly : I miss girls.

Jon Snow : Why is he alone?

Sam Tarly : One blast for a Ranger returning, two for Wildlings, three for...

Jon Snow : There's no rider.

Night Watch Stable Boy : Whoa, boy, whoa.

Jon Snow : That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.

Renly Baratheon : Ned! It's Robert.

Robert Baratheon : I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man.

Robert Baratheon : My fault. Too much wine, missed my thrust.

Cersei Lannister : Robert, my sweet...

Robert Baratheon : Out, all of you!

Eddard Stark : You damned fool.

Robert Baratheon : Paper and ink on the table, write down what I say.

Robert Baratheon : Give it to the council after I'm dead.

Eddard Stark : I will.

Robert Baratheon : And my son Help him, Ned. Make him better than me.

Eddard Stark : I'll, I'll do everything I can to honor your memory.

Robert Baratheon : My memory.

Eddard Stark : Give him milk of the poppy.

Barristan Selmy : He was reeling from the wine.

Eddard Stark : No man could have protected him from himself.

Lord Varys : I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?

Barristan Selmy : His squire, from the king's own skin.

Eddard Stark : His squire? The Lannister boy?

Lord Varys : Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment.

Eddard Stark : His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.

Lord Varys : I'm afraid those birds have flown.

Khal Drogo : The stallion who mounts the world, has no need for iron chairs.

Daenerys Targaryen : According to the prophecy, the stallions will ride to the ends of the world.

Khal Drogo : The earth ends at the black salt sea. No horse can cross the poison water.

Daenerys Targaryen : The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea.

Khal Drogo : Not dirt. Lands.

Daenerys Targaryen : Lands, yes...

Khal Drogo : Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.

Daenerys Targaryen : It's not a chair. It's a...

Daenerys Targaryen : A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen.

Khal Drogo : A King does not need a chair to sit upon. He only needs a horse.

Daenerys Targaryen : Can't you help me make him understand?

Jorah Mormont : The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons.

Daenerys Targaryen : My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.

Jorah Mormont : Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right.

Daenerys Targaryen : And because he had dragons.

Jorah Mormont : Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier.

Daenerys Targaryen : You don't believe it.

Jorah Mormont : Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report.

Deanerys Targarian : Well, I'll come with you.

Jorah Mormont : No no, don't trouble yourself. Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough.

Little Bird : Psst, Jorah the Andal.

Wine Merchant : Virzetha gizikhven! Mra qora! Mra qora!

Daenerys Targaryen : My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine.

Wine Merchant : My Lady, you are from Westeros.

Doreah : You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen.

Wine Merchant : Princess.

Daenerys Targaryen : Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine.

Wine Merchant : That? Dornish swill.

Daenerys Targaryen : You honor me, Ser.

Wine Merchant : The honor...the honor is all mine.

Rakharo : Huh-uh, huh-uh.

Wine Merchant : You know there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess.

Daenerys Targaryen : I hope to repay your kindness someday.

Jorah Mormont : Rakharo.

Rakharo : Huh.

Daenerys Targaryen : Is something wrong?

Jorah Mormont : I have a thirst. Open it.

Wine Merchant : The wine is for the Khaleesi. It's not for the likes of you.

Jorah Mormont : Open it.

Jorah Mormont : Pour.

Wine Merchant : It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.

Daenerys Targaryen : Do as he says.

Wine Merchant : As the princess commands.

Wine Merchant : Sweet, isn't it? Can you smell the fruit, Ser? Taste it, My Lord.

Jorah Mormont : You first.

Wine Merchant : Me? I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.

Daenerys Targaryen : You will drink.

Doreah : Khaleesi! Stop him!

Jorah Mormont : Come.

Jeor Mormont : Here you begin anew.

Jon Snow : I do, my lord.

Jeor Mormont : You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.

Jon Snow : Yes, my lord.

Jeor Mormont : You'll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall. And your old Gods too, maybe.

Sam Tarly : my lord, might I go as well?

Jeor Mormont : Does house Tarly keep the old Gods?

Sam Tarly : No, my lord.

Sam Tarly : The Night's Watch is my house now.

Jeor Mormont : As you wish, lad.

Jaremy Rykker : Rangers with me.

Othell Yarwyck : Builders!

Maester Aemon : Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library.

Jon Snow : Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.

Maester Aemon : Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers.

Jon Snow : Do you take me for a servant?

Maester Aemon : We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.

Jon Snow : May I go?

Maester Aemon : As you wish.

Sam Tarly : Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?

Jon Snow : I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.

Pypar : Fair? I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.

Sam Tarly : I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?

Pypar : You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?

Sam Tarly : Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song.

Sam Tarly : Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.

Jon Snow : I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger.

Sam Tarly : I always wanted to be a Wizard.

Renly Baratheon : She won't care.

Eddard Stark : And what should I do with a hundred swords?

Renly Baratheon : Strike! Tonight while the castle sleeps.

Eddard Stark : What about Stannis?

Renly Baratheon : Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?

Eddard Stark : Stannis is your older brother.

Renly Baratheon : This isn't about the bloody line of succession.

Eddard Stark : Stannis is a commander. He's led men into war twice.

Renly Baratheon : Yes, he's a good soldier. Everyone knows that. So was Robert.

Tell Me Something : Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?

Eddard Stark : I will not dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.

Eddard Stark : You will sail to dragonstone tonight.

Tomard : Yes, My Lord.

Eddard Stark : Now leave us.

Petyr Baelish : My Lord protector.

Eddard Stark : The King has no true born sons.

Petyr Baelish : So when the King dies...

Eddard Stark : The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis.

Petyr Baelish : So it would seem. Unless...

Eddard Stark : There is no "unless".

Petyr Baelish : And he cannot take the throne without your help.

Eddard Stark : Do you have a shred of honor?

Petyr Baelish : You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.

Eddard Stark : We?

Petyr Baelish : You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest.

Eddard Stark : What you suggest is treason.

Petyr Baelish : Only if we lose.

Eddard Stark : Make peace with the Lannisters, you say. With the people who tried to murder my boy..

Eddard Stark : No. I won't do it.

Petyr Baelish : So it will be Stannis and war?

Eddard Stark : There is no other choice. He is the heir.

Petyr Baelish : So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly.

Eddard Stark : You promised Catelyn you would help me.

Petyr Baelish : Look at you. You know what you want me to do.

Daenerys Targaryen : I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone.

Daenerys Targaryen : He will not have my son.

Khal Drogo : Moon of my life. Are you hurt?

Khal Drogo : Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did.

King Joffrey : Liar!

Cersei Lannister : You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark.

Eddard Stark : Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man. Do him no harm.

Cersei Lannister : You think he stands alone?

King Joffrey : Kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!

Eddard Stark : Commander! Take the Queen and her children into custody.

Janos Slynt : Men of the Watch!

Eddard Stark : I want no bloodshed.

Petyr Baelish : Now!

Petyr Baelish : I did warn you not to trust me.

Syrio Forel : Yah! Left high, left low.

Syrio Forel : Right low, lunge right.

Steward Of House Stark : If you break anything, the Septa will have my head. What is...

Septa Mordane : Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.

Sansa Stark : She didn't forget. She's with her dancing master.

Septa Mordane : Hush! Go back to your room.

Sansa Stark : What is it? What's happening?

Septa Mordane : Do as I told you. Run!

Syrio Forel : This way! Left, right.

Arya Stark : You said right, but you went left.

Syrio Forel : And now you are a dead girl.

Arya Stark : Only 'cause you lied.

Syrio Forel : My tongue lied.

Arya Stark : I was so. I watched, but you...

Syrio Forel : Watching is not seeing, dead girl.

Meryn Trant : Arya Stark, come with us.

Syrio Forel : And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own? I am wondering.

Meryn Trant : Mind your place, dancing master.

Arya Stark : My father wouldn't send you.

Arya Stark : And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.

Maryn Trant : Take her.

Syrio Forel : Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?

Kings Guard : Get out of my way, little man.

Syrio Forel : I am Syrio Forel.

Kings Guard : Foreign bastard.

Syrio Forel : And you will be speaking to me with more respect.

Meryn Trant : Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.

Syrio Forel : Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.

Meryn Trant : Bloody oafs.

Syrio Forel : Be gone now, Arya.

Arya Stark : Come with me. Run.

Syrio Forel : The first sword of Braavos does not run.

Syrio Forel : What do we say to the God of death?

Arya Stark : Not today.

Syrio Forel : Go.

Arya Stark : Not today. Not today.

Sansa Stark : Stay away from me.

Sandor Clegane : Who do you think sent me?

Arya Stark : Needle.

Stable Boy : There she is.

Arya Stark : What do you want?

Stable Boy : I want you, wolf girl. Come here.

Arya Stark : Leave me be. My father's a lord. He'll reward you.

Stable Boy : She'll reward me, the Queen!

Arya Stark : Stay away!

Lord Varys : Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.

Eddard Stark : Varys.

Lord Varys : I promise you it isn't poisoned.

Eddard Stark : What about my daughters?

Lord Varys : The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.

Eddard Stark : And Sansa?

Lord Varys : Still engaged to Joffrey.

Eddard Stark : You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.

Lord Varys : And would again, My Lord.

Eddard Stark : The madness of mercy. That she might save her children.

Lord Varys : Ah, the children. It is always the innocents who suffer.

Eddard Stark : The Queen can't kill me. Cat holds her brother.

Lord Varys : The wrong brother sadly.

Eddard Stark : If that's true, then slit my throat and be done with it.

Lord Varys : Not today, My Lord.

Eddard Stark : Tell me something, Varys.

Lord Varys : The Realm, My Lord.

Jeor Mormont : It's Othor, without a doubt.

Othell Yarwyck : The other one is Jafer Flowers, My Lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.

Jeor Mormont : Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?

Jon Snow : Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say.

Jeor Mormont : Mmm.

Sam Tarly : The smell.

Othell Yarwyck : What smell?

Sam Tarly : There is none.

Jon Snow : We should burn them.

Othell Yarwyck : Snow's not wrong, My Lord.

Jeor Mormont : I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.

Othell Yarwyck : You heard him.

Ser Alliser : Lord Commander, Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers. A raven from King's Landing.

Nights Watch Brother : Come on, move 'em out.

Jeor Mormont : Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.

Jon Snow : Is there any word of my father?

Jeor Mormont : Sit.

Jeor Mormont : I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.

Jon Snow : My sisters were in King's Landing too.

Jeor Mormont : I'm sure they'll be treated gently.

Lord Varys : Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.

Grand Maester Pycelle : King Robert's body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

Sansa Stark : He wouldn't do that. He knows how much I love Joffrey.

Cersei Lannister : Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.

Grand Maester Pycelle : A child born of a traitor's seed is no fit consort for our King.

Sansa Stark : No, I'm not.

Petyr Baelish : The girl is innocent, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest.

Sansa Stark : Robb.

Cersei Lannister : Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.

Sansa Stark : If...if I could see my father, talk to him about...

Cersei Lannister : You disappoint me, child.

Sansa Stark : I only meant that...what will happen to him?

Cersei Lannister : That depends.

Sansa Stark : On...on what?

Cersei Lannister : On your brother. And on you.

Robb Stark : Treason? Sansa wrote this?

Maester Luwin : It is your sister's hand, but the Queen's words.

Robb Stark : Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?

Maester Luwin : This is a royal command, My Lord.

Robb Stark : I won't refuse. His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing.

Robin Arryn : I'm hungry.

Lysa Arryn : Hush now, darling. You just ate.

Catelyn Stark : You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?

Robin Arryn : But I'm hungry!

Lysa Arryn : Soon, love, soon.

Catelyn Stark : That is what I ask.

Lysa Arryn : Go on, sweet. Time for your bath. I'll feed you after.

Catelyn Stark : If you fear for the safety of your son...

Lysa Arryn : Of course I fear for the safety of my son!

Catelyn Stark : And that is why we have to stop them.

Lysa Arryn : The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their Lord.

Tyrion Lannister : From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.

Shagga : Best for Tyrion son of Tywin. Not best for me.

Tyrion Lannister : And feed it to the goats, yes.

Tyrion Lannister : Uncle. Father.

Tywin Lannister : The rumors of your demise were unfounded.

Tyrion Lannister : Sorry to disappoint you.

Tywin Lannister : And who are these Companions of yours?

Tywin Lannister : This is Shagga Son of Dolf, Chieftain of the Stone Crows.

Bronn : You wouldn't know him.

Tyrion Lannister : May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister.

Tywin Lannister : You left us no choice. The honor of the House was at stake.

Tyrion Lannister : We have our differences, Jaime and I.

Jaime Lannister : He's been covering himself in glory.

Kevan Lannister : Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark's homeland.

Tyrion Lannister : And the Starks? Lord Eddard?

Tywin Lannister : Is our hostage.

Tyrion Lannister : How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?

Tywin Lannister : Robert Baratheon is dead.

Tyrion Lannister : My sister rules, you mean.

Kevan Lannister : Stark's son has called his banners.

Tywin Lannister : A green boy.

Tyrion Lannister : Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.

Messenger : If it please My Lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck.

Tywin Lannister : The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.

Kevan Lannister : At once, My Lord.

Tywin Lannister : It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.

Shagga : Only if the half man fights with us.

Rodrik Cassal : The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.

Greatjon Umber : No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.

Robb Stark : To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.

Theon Greyjoy : Lord Frey controls that bridge.

Catelyn Stark : The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.

Theon Greyjoy : Robb's right.

Greatjon Umber : So what's it gonna be? Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?

Stark Guard : Your pardon, my lords.

Greatjon Umber : Don't worry, lad.

Robb Stark : Where did you find him?

Stark Guard : In the brush above the encampment.

Robb Stark : How high did you get?

Lannister Scout : 20,000. Maybe more.

Robb Stark : My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.

Catelyn Stark : Robb.

Robb Stark : Tell Lord Tywin, Winter is coming for him.

Lannister Scout : Yes, My Lord. Thank you, My Lord.

Greatjon Umber : Are you touched, boy?! Letting him go?

Robb Stark : You call me boy again.

Robb Stark : Go on.

Greatjon Umber : Oi.

Grand Maester Pycelle : It is also the wish of His Grace, that his loyal servant Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch...

Sansa Stark : Ser Aron.

Grand Maester Pycelle : Be at once raised to the rank of Lord.

Sansa Stark : Lord Gyles.

Grand Maester Pycelle : And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him, until the end of time.

Cersei Lannister : Ser Barristan Selmy.

Barristan Selmy : Your Grace, I am yours to command.

Cersei Lannister : Rise, Ser Barristan.

Barristan Selmy : Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.

Cersei Lannister : Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's?

King Joffrey : You let my father die.

Barristan Selmy : Your Grace...

Cersei Lannister : The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

Barristan Selmy : The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend!

Cersei Lannister : Careful, Ser.

Lord Varys : We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good Ser.

Barristan Selmy : A hall to die in and men to bury me.

Petyr Baelish : A naked Knight, apparently.

Barristan Selmy : Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!

Kings Landing Page : If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.

Sansa Stark : Your Grace.

King Joffrey : Come forward, My Lady.

Kings Landing Page : The Lady Sansa of House Stark.

Cersei Lannister : Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?

Sansa Stark : I do.

Sansa Stark : As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.

Grand Maester Pycelle : Treason is a noxious weed.

King Joffrey : Let her speak.

Sansa Stark : Thank you, Your Grace.

Petyr Baelish : Do you deny your father's crime?

Sansa Stark : No, My Lords. I know he must be punished.

King Joffrey : He said I wasn't the King. Why did he say that?

Sansa Stark : He was badly hurt.

Lord Varys : A childo s faith Such sweet innocence.

Grand Maester Pycelle : Treason is treason!

King Joffrey : Anything else?

Sansa Stark : If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.

King Joffrey : Your sweet words have moved me.

Sansa Stark : He will.

Varys : You've seen better days, my lord.

Eddard Stark : Another visit? lt seems you're my last friend.

Varys : No, no, many still love you. Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life.

Eddard Stark : On her knees begging for me. Hm! Did you laugh with the others?

Varys : You do me wrong, my lord. Your blood is the last thing l want.

Eddard Stark : l don't know what you want. l've given up trying to guess.

Varys : When l was still a boy - before they cut my balls off with a hot knife - l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play. The same is true at court. l am the master of whisperers. My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. l'm a good actor, my lord.

Eddard Stark : Huh. Can you free me from this pit?

Varys : l could. But will l? No. As l said, I'm no hero.

Eddard Stark : What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories. Tell me, what do you want?

Varys : Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.

Eddard Stark : Robb? He's just a boy.

Varys : Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.

Eddard Stark : Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.

Varys : Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.

Eddard Stark : You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?

Varys : l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.

Eddard Stark : You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.

Varys : Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?

Robb Stark : lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.

Theon Greyjoy : Or so Walder Frey would have you think.

Catelyn Stark : Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.

Robb Stark : He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?

Greatjon Umber : Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.

Robb Stark : Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.

Theon Greyjoy : Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.

Greatjon Umber : Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.

Catelyn Stark : The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.

Robb Stark : Have my horse saddled and ready.

Greatjon Umber : Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.

Theon Greyjoy : Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.

Robb Stark : My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.

Catelyn Stark : l agree. l'll go.

Everyone : You can't!

Catelyn Stark : l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.

Greatjon Umber : Unless there was a profit in it.

Walder Frey : What do you want?

Catelyn Stark : lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord.

Walder Frey : Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?

Stevron Frey : Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is -

Walder Frey : Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?

Ryger Rivers : Father, please -

Walder Frey : l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly.

Catelyn Stark : ls there somewhere we can talk?

Walder Frey : We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you!

Catelyn Stark : l'm sure she will give you many sons.

Walder Frey : Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.

Catelyn Stark : He is quite ill, my lord.

Walder Frey : Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me.

Catelyn Stark : My lord, l -

Walder Frey : Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.

Catelyn Stark : l'm sure there were reasons -

Walder Frey : l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?

Catelyn Stark : To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.

Walder Frey : Why should l let him?

Catelyn Stark : lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls.

Walder Frey : There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husbando s in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm.

Catelyn Stark : You swore an oath to my father.

Walder Frey : Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.

Catelyn Stark : Why don't you?

Walder Frey : Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?

Voices Outside : And engage!

Jeor Mormont : When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?

Jon Snow : Soon, he says.

Jeor Mormont : Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think.

Jon Snow : This is Valyrian steel.

Jeor Mormont : lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.

Jon Snow : My lord, you honor me, but l can't -

Jeor Mormont : Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?

Jon Snow : Yes, my lord.

Jeor Mormont : Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it.

Jon Snow : l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.

Jeor Mormont : No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist - l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper.

Unidentified Nights Watchers : Well done. Well done.

Nights Watcher : You earned that, Snow.

Nights Watcher : Well done.

Pyp : Go on, let's have a look.

Jon Snow : At what?

Grenn : The sword! Show us the sword.

All : Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

Pyp : Let's have a look.

Grenn : Piss off.

Pyp : Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!

Grenn : Look at its eyes.

Jon Snow : What is it?

Sam Tarly : l - l can't.

Jon Snow : You can't what?

Sam Tarly : l'm really not supposed to say.

Jon Snow : And yet you really want to say. You want to say that.

Sam Tarly : There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.

Jon Snow : What? What about him?

Sam Tarly : He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe.

Jon Snow : l should be there. l should be with him.

Greatjon Umber : lf we do that, they'll never get back across.

Robb Stark : Well? What did he say?

Catelyn Stark : Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well.

Robb Stark : Huh.

Catelyn Stark : Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.

Robb Stark : What does he want in return?

Catelyn Stark : You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.

Robb Stark : Fine, fine. And?

Catelyn Stark : And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.

Robb Stark : She won't be happy about that. And?

Catelyn Stark : And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.

Robb Stark : l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?

Catelyn Stark : l did.

Robb Stark : And?

Catelyn Stark : One was - Do you consent?

Robb Stark : Can l refuse?

Catelyn Stark : Not if you want to cross.

Robb Stark : Then l consent.

Jon Snow : Sam said you wanted to see me?

Maester Aemon : l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?

Jon Snow : No.

Maester Aemon : So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?

Jon Snow : He would do whatever was right, no matter what.

Maester Aemon : Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?

Jon Snow : Sam told you.

Maester Aemon : We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose.

Jon Snow : And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?

Maester Aemon : Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know.

Jon Snow : You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother.

Maester Aemon : The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South

Jon Snow : Who are you?

Maester Aemon : My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King.

Jon Snow : You're Aemon Targaryen.

Maester Aemon : l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have.

Daenerys Targaryen : My lord. My sun and stars. Drogo.

Khal Drogo : My horse.

Cohollo : Blood of my blood.

Khal Drogo : No, l must ride.

Qotho : He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.

Daenerys Targaryen : He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here.

Qotho : This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.

Qotho : You do not command me, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.

Qotho : The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.

Qotho : Hyah! Hyah!

Kevan Lannister : Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. They're a day's march north.

Tywin Lannister : The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.

Tywin Lannister : l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.

Kevan Lannister : The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided.

Tyrion Lannister : Shagga likes axes.

Tywin Lannister : When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.

Tyrion Lannister : The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?

Kevan Lannister : They do seem rather ferocious.

Tyrion Lannister : Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.

Tywin Lannister : When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.

Tyrion Lannister : Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.

Tywin Lannister : There'll be no more discussion on the matter.

Tyrion Lannister : lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords.

Tyrion Lannister : Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?

Bronn : l took her.

Tyrion Lannister : Took her? From whom?

Bronn : From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.

Tyrion Lannister : And he didn't have anything to say about it?

Bronn : He said something.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.

Bronn : Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one.

Tyrion Lannister : Who are you?

Prostitute : Who would you like me to be?

Tyrion Lannister : What did your mother call you?

Prostitute : Shae. What did your mother call you?

Tyrion Lannister : My mother died giving birth to me.

Shae : ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?

Tyrion Lannister : What sort of accent is that?

Shae : Foreign.

Tyrion Lannister : For-

Shae : What do you want from me?

Tyrion Lannister : What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be.

Shae : And what do l get?

Tyrion Lannister : One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular.

Shae : Who told you this? Women you paid?

Tyrion Lannister : And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?

Shae : Let's start with your last night in this world.

Jorah Mormont : Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.

Jorah Mormont : He will die tonight, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : He can't. He can't. l won't let him.

Jorah Mormont : Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.

Daenerys Targaryen : l won't leave him.

Jorah Mormont : He's already gone, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo.

Jorah Mormont : This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.

Mirri Maz Duur : The wound has festered.

Qotho : You did this, witch.

Daenerys Targaryen : Stop it! l don't want her hurt.

Qotho : No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.

Jorah Mormont : Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.

Qotho : Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing.

Daenerys Targaryen : l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.

Qotho : The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser.

Jorah Mormont : l think you're right.

Mirri Maz Duur : You've saved me once more.

Daenerys Targaryen : And now you must save him.

Mirri Maz Duur : He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.

Daenerys Targaryen : Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some - some magic.

Mirri Maz Duur : There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.

Daenerys Targaryen : Do it. Save him.

Mirri Maz Duur : There is a price.

Daenerys Targaryen : You'll have gold, whatever you want.

Mirri Maz Duur : lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.

Daenerys Targaryen : My death?

Mirri Maz Duur : No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse.

Rakharo : Khaleesi, do not do this thing. Let me kill this witch.

Daenerys Targaryen : Kill her and you kill your khal.

Rakharo : This is blood magic. lt is forbidden.

Daenerys Targaryen : l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.

Mirri Maz Duur : Go. Now.

Daenerys Targaryen : Take her and leave. Take her!

Mirri Maz Duur : You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. The dead will dance here tonight.

Daenerys Targaryen : No one will enter.

Daenerys Targaryen : Bring him back to me.

Daenerys Targaryen : l have to save him.

Qotho : This must not be.

Daenerys Targaryen : This must be.

Qotho : Witch.

Rakharo : Nothing good will come of this.

Daenerys Targaryen : No, you can't.

Irri : Khaleesi!

Jorah Mormont : No further, horselord.

Jorah Mormont : Are you hurt?

Daenerys Targaryen : The baby -

Jorah Mormont : Hmm?

Daenerys Targaryen : is coming.

Jorah Mormont : Fetch the midwives.

Rakharo : They will not come. They say she is cursed.

Jorah Mormont : They'll come or l'll have their heads.

Rakharo : The witch - she can bring baby. l hear her say so.

Shae : Are you in agony, my lion?

Tyrion Lannister : No.

Shae : You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?

Shae : Just used to it.

Bronn : Drink.

Tyrion Lannister : Let's play a new game.

Bronn : There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.

Tyrion Lannister : Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?

Bronn : Not if you win.

Tyrion Lannister : No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at.

Shae : What are you good at?

Tyrion Lannister : l happen to be a great judge of character.

Bronn : This sounds like a boring game.

Tyrion Lannister : lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying.

Shae : l don't want to play this game.

Tyrion Lannister : Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.

Bronn : But my mother hit harder.

Tyrion Lannister : You killed your first man before you were 12.

Bronn : lt was a woman. She swung an axe at me.

Tyrion Lannister : You've been north of the Wall.

Shae : What brought you up there?

Bronn : Work.

Tyrion Lannister : And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.

Shae : l don't want to play.

Tyrion Lannister : lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.

Shae : Drink.

Tyrion Lannister : All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.

Tyrion Lannister : And we've established the rules about lying?

Shae : Drink!

Tyrion Lannister : You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.

Bronn : The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.

Tyrion Lannister : So, specifics. You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?

Tyrion Lannister : Are you sure -

Shae : Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head.

Tyrion Lannister : My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize.

Shae : My turn.

Tyrion Lannister : Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.

Shae : Who were you in love with?

Tyrion Lannister : That's not how the game works.

Shae : l don't care the way the game works.

Bronn : Our lord here used to be married.

Shae : Married?

Tyrion Lannister : How did you hear that?

Bronn : You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.

Tyrion Lannister : Another night, perhaps.

Shae : Not another night. This night.

Tyrion Lannister : lt's not a pleasant story.

Shae : Oh, maybe l will cry.

Bronn : l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.

Tyrion Lannister : So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed.

Bronn : For three chickens, l should hope so.

Tyrion Lannister : lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father.

Bronn : Well, l imagine that was the end of all that.

Tyrion Lannister : Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.

Bronn : l would have killed the man who did that to me.

Shae : You should have known she was a whore.

Tyrion Lannister : Really? l was 16, drunk and in love.

Shae : A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.

Tyrion Lannister : As l said, l was young and stupid.

Shae : You are still young and stupid.

Tyrion Lannister : What is it? What do you want?

Bronn : You're sleeping through the war.

Tyrion Lannister : What?

Bronn : They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.

Tyrion Lannister : Get my squire!

Bronn : You don't have a squire.

Tyrion Lannister : lf l die, weep for me.

Shae : You'll be dead. How will you know?

Tyrion Lannister : l'll know.

Lannister Soldier : Watch out! Move!

Lannister Soldier : Out of the way! Move aside!

Bronn : Stay low.

Tyrion Lannister : Stay low?

Bronn : lf you're lucky, no one will notice you.

Tyrion Lannister : l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!

Tribesmen Of Vale : Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man!

Tyrion Lannister : To battle!

Bronn : You're a shit warrior.

Tyrion Lannister : l'm alive?

Bronn : You're alive.

Tyrion Lannister : Did we win?

Bronn : We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.

Tyrion Lannister : How did our tribesmen do?

Bronn : Yeah, good.

Tyrion Lannister : lt's nice to see them getting along.

Tywin Lannister : You're wounded.

Tyrion Lannister : Good of you to notice. l hear we won.

Tywin Lannister : Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand].

Tyrion Lannister : Did we get the Stark boy, at least?

Tywin Lannister : He wasn't here.

Tyrion Lannister : Where was he?

Tywin Lannister : With his other 18,000 men.

Tyrion Lannister : And where are they?

Rodrik Cassel : We should go, my lady.

Catelyn Stark : No!

Rodrik Cassel : My lady!

Stark Bannermen : Hyah! Hyah!

Robb Stark : By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened.

Jaime Lannister : Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it.

Catelyn Stark : lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.

Jaime Lannister : l've lost them too, l'm afraid.

Theon Greyjoy : Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.

Robb Stark : He's more use to us alive than dead.

Catelyn Stark : Take him away and put him in irons.

Jaime Lannister : We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now.

Robb Stark : lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way.

Greatjon Umber : Come on, pretty man.

Robb Stark : l sent 2,000 men to their graves today.

Theon Greyjoy : The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.

Robb Stark : Aye. But the dead won't hear them. One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.

Arya Stark : Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.

Kings Landing Baker : Three coppers.

Arya Stark : How about a nice fat pigeon?

Kings Landing Baker : Oh, piss off now. Go on.

Arya Stark : Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?

Kings Landing Baker : Piss off!

Arya Stark : Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?

Street Urchin : They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.

Arya Stark : Who?

Street Urchin : The Hand of the King.

Populace : Traitor! Coward!

Eddark Stark : Baelor!

Populace : Traitor! Traitor!

Eddark Stark : I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say

Grand Maester Pycelle : As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?

Joffrey Lannister : My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!

Sansa Stark : No, stop! Please, someone stop him!

Cersei Lannister : My son, this is madness.

Populace : Put him down!

Yoren : Don't look!

Arya Stark : Let me go.

Yoren : Shut your mouth. Look at me.

Sansa Stark : Stop him, stop!

Yoren : Look at me. Look at me! Do you remember me now, boy, eh? Remember me? There's a bright boy. You'll be coming with me, boy, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.

Yoren : Keep your mouth shut, boy.

Arya Stark : l'm not a boy!

Yoren : You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say? Do you want to live, boy?! North, boy, we're going north.

Bran Stark : lt had three eyes. lt told me to come with him, so l did. We went down into the crypts and my father was there.

Osha : Your father's not down there, little lord. Not for many years yet.

Bran Stark : You're afraid. Just like Hodor.

Osha : l'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.

Bran Stark : You've lived beyond the Wall. What are you scared of? l'm a crippled boy and l'm willing to go.

Bran Stark : That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard. He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys. That's Lyanna, my father's sister. King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her. Robert started a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway. That's where l saw Father.

Osha : You see? He's not here.

Rickon Stark : Here, Shaggydog.

Bran Stark : Rickon!

Osha : That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!

Rickon Stark : He doesn't like chains.

Bran Stark : What are you doing down here? Come back up with us.

Rickon Stark : No, l came to see Father.

Bran Stark : How many times have l told you? He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.

Rickon Stark : He was down here. l saw him.

Bran Stark : Saw him when?

Rickon Stark : Last night, when l was sleeping. Here, Shaggydog.

Osha : You both miss him. lt's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn't mean that -

Maester Luwin : Bran.

Several Stark Bannermen : My lady. My lady. My lady.

Catelyn Stark : Robb. Robb! You've ruined your sword.

Catelyn Stark : Shh! Shh! Shh!

Robb Stark : l'll kill them all. Every one of them. l will kill them all.

Catelyn Stark : My boy. They have your sisters. We have to get the girls back. And then we will kill them all.

Joffrey Lannister : Very amusing. lsn't it a funny song? Thank you for your rendition. l imagine it was even better received at that tavern.

Marillion : l'm so sorry, Your Grace. l'll never sing it again, l swear.

Joffrey Lannister : Tell me, which do you favor - your fingers or your tongue?

Marillion : Your Grace?

Joffrey Lannister : Fingers or your tongue? lf you got to keep one, which would it be? Or l could just cut your throat.

Marillion : Every man needs hands, Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : Good. Tongue it is.

Marillion : Your Grace, please. l won't sing, Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : Ser llyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence?

Marillion : l beg you! Please, no. No!

Marillion : Your Grace, please. l beg you, l will never sing again! No!

Joffrey Lannister : l'm done for the day. l'll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother.

Marillion : Your Grace, please!

Joffrey Lannister : You look quite nice.

Sansa Stark : Thank you, my lord.

Joffrey Lannister : Your Grace. l'm King now.

Marillion : Stop! No!

Joffrey Lannister : Walk with me. l want to show you something.

Sandor Clegane : Do as you're bid, child.

Joffrey Lannister : And as soon as you've had your blood, l'll put a son in you. Mother says that shouldn't be long.

Sansa Stark : No! Please, no!

Joffrey Lannister : This one's your father. This one here. Look at it and see what happens to traitors.

Sansa Stark : You promised to be merciful.

Joffrey Lannister : l was. l gave him a clean death. Look at him.

Sansa Stark : Please let me go home. l won't do any treason, l swear -

Joffrey Lannister : Mother says l'm still to marry you. So you'll stay here, and obey. Look at him!

Joffrey Lannister : Well?

Sansa Stark : How long do l have to look?

Joffrey Lannister : As long as it pleases me. Do you want to see the rest?

Sansa Stark : lf it please Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : That's your Septa there. l'll tell you what, l'm going to give you a present. After l raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, l'm going to give you his head as well.

Sansa Stark : Or maybe he'll give me yours.

Sandor Clegane : Here, girl.

Joffrey Lannister : Will you obey now? Or do you need another lesson? l'll look for you in court.

Sandor Clegane : Save yourself some pain, girl. Give him what he wants.

Sandor Clegane : You'll be needing that again.

Jonos Bracken : The proper course is clear - pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.

Robb Stark : Renly is not the king.

Jonos Bracken : You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord. He put your father to death.

Robb Stark : That doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis.

Jonos Bracken : Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?

Galbart Glover : Renly is not right! lf we put ourselves behind Stannis.

Greatjon Umber : My Lords. My Lords! Here is what l say to these two kings. Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? Even their gods are wrong! Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead! There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to - the King in the North!

Rickard Karstark : l'll have peace on those terms. They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too. The King in the North!

Theon Greyjoy : Am l your brother, now and always?

Robb Stark : Now and always.

Theon Greyjoy : My sword is yours in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day.

Greatjon Umber : The King in the North!

All : The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!

Stark Guard : Lady Stark.

Catelyn Stark : l want to see him. Now! Leave us.

Catelyn Stark : Leave us.

Jaime Lannister : You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. Your bed must be lonely. ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it. Oh, l do like a violent woman.

Catelyn Stark : l will kill you tonight, Ser. Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister.

Jaime Lannister : Let me show you how. Hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look, it shouldn't take long.

Catelyn Stark : That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death.

Jaime Lannister : But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?

Catelyn Stark : Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just.

Jaime Lannister : What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?

Catelyn Stark : Because of men like you.

Jaime Lannister : There are no men like me. Only me.

Catelyn Stark : My son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower?

Jaime Lannister : l pushed him out the window.

Catelyn Stark : Why?

Jaime Lannister : I hoped the fall would kill him.

Jaime Lannister : You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war.

Lancel Lannister : l can't believe we're actually at war. Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? What does it say? Have we captured Robb Stark yet? What's our next move?

Cersei Lannister : Stop talking. Get back into bed.

Tywin Lannister : They have my son.

Tyrion Lannister : The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.

Leo Lefford : l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.

Addam Marbrand : ls it true about Stannis and Renly?

Kevan Lannister : Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. Jaime captured, his armies scattered. lt's a catastrophe. Perhaps we should sue for peace.

Tyrion Lannister : There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning - in case you hadn't noticed.

Kevan Lannister : l'm told we still have his sisters.

Leo Lefford : The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.

Addam Marbrand : Kevan Lannister

Tywin Lannister : They have my son! Get out, all of you. Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now - madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong.

Tyrion Lannister : Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.

Tywin Lannister : No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from Godo s Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.

Tyrion Lannister : And do what?

Tywin Lannister : Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest - Baelish, Varys, Pycelle.

Tyrion Lannister : Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?

Tywin Lannister : You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?

Daenerys Targaryen : Ser Jorah?

Jorah Mormont : Gently, gently.

Daenerys Targaryen : My son - where is he? l want him. Where is he?

Jorah Mormont : The boy did not live.

Daenerys Targaryen : Tell me.

Jorah Mormont : What is there to tell?

Daenerys Targaryen : How did my son die?

Jorah Mormont : He never lived, my princess. The women say -

Daenerys Targaryen : What do the women say?

Jorah Mormont : They say the child was -

Mirri Maz Duur : Monstrous, twisted. l pulled him out myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. When l touched him the skin fell from his bones. Inside he was full of graveworms. l warned you that only death can pay for life. You knew the price.

Daenerys Targaryen : Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.

Mirri Maz Duur : As you command, lady. Come. l will take you to him.

Jorah Mormont : Time enough for that later -

Daenerys Targaryen : l want to see him now.

Daenerys Targaryen : The khalasar is gone.

Jorah Mormont : A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess.

Daenerys Targaryen : Drogo! My sun and stars. Why is he out here alone?

Jorah Mormont : He seems to like the warmth, Princess.

Mirri Maz Duur : He lives. You asked for life, you paid for life.

Daenerys Targaryen : This is not life. When will he be as he was?

Mirri Maz Duur : When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.

Daenerys Targaryen : Leave us.

Jorah Mormont : l don't want you alone with this sorceress.

Daenerys Targaryen : l have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go.

Daenerys Targaryen : You knew what l was buying and you knew the price.

Mirri Maz Duur : lt was wrong of them to burn my temple. lt angered the Great Shepherd.

Daenerys Targaryen : This is not Godo s work. My child was innocent.

Mirri Maz Duur : lnnocent? He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World. Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.

Daenerys Targaryen : l spoke for you. l saved you.

Mirri Maz Duur : Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my godo s house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?

Daenerys Targaryen : Your life.

Mirri Maz Duur : Why don't you take a look at your khal. Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.

Sam Tarly : You can't!

Jon Snow : Get out of my way, Sam.

Sam Tarly : They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters?

Jon Snow : Better than you do.

Sam Tarly : What are you going to do?

Jon Snow : l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.

Sam Tarly : You can't leave us now. We need you here.

Jon Snow : Move.

Sam Tarly : l won't let you go.

Sam Tarly : No.

Jon Snow : Hyah!

Shae : Hand of the King?

Tyrion Lannister : So it would seem.

Shae : And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing?

Tyrion Lannister : No, he said l couldn't take with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point.

Shae : He knew my name?

Tyrion Lannister : What?

Shae : He said, "Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing"?

Tyrion Lannister : l believe he used the word "whore".

Shae : Are you ashamed of me? Are you afraid that l'm dancing around the court with my tits out?

Shae : I'm funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore.

Tyrion Lannister : My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hando s lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand -

Shae : l know what a Hand needs.

Jon Snow : Ghost?

Sam Pyp And Grenn : Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

Grenn : Samwell!

Pyp : ls he dead?

Grenn : No, he's not dead.

Sam Tarly : Did we get him?

Grenn : Come on, help me get him up.

Pyp : Lucky you've got plenty of padding. We're taking you back to where you belong.

Jon Snow : l belong with my brother.

Sam Tarly : But we're your brothers now.

Grenn : They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.

Jon Snow : They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.

Pyp : Sam told us everything. We're sorry about your father.

Grenn : But it doesn't matter. You took the oath. You can't leave.

Jon Snow : l have to.

Grenn : You can't. You said the words.

Jon Snow : I don't care about -

Sam Tarly : Hear my words and bear witness to my vow

Jon Snow : To hell with all of you.

Pyp : Night gathers and now my watch begins. lt shall not end until my death. l shall live and die at my post.

Grenn : l am the sword in the darkness -

Sam Pyp And Grenn : l am the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realms of men. l pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come."�

Daenerys Targaryen : Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars.

Daenerys Targaryen : When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars.

Grand Maester Pycelle : Kings? Oh, l can tell you all there is to know about kings. The thing you need to understand about kings is - For the past 67 years, l've known truly known more kings than any man alive. They're complicated men, but l know how to serve them. Yes, and keep on serving them. Aerys Targaryen. Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. He was a good man. Such a charmer. To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood. Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal - powerful man, great warrior, but alas - winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things. They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. Now l serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign.

Grand Maester Pycelle : He is a capable young man. Strong military mind. Stern. But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. lt's far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. Mmm. True greatness.

Ros : So what's the thing?

Grand Maester Pycelle : What thing?

Ros : About kings. You said, "The thing you need to understand about kings".

Grand Maester Pycelle : What? Things? What?

Ros : When you started, you. Never mind.

Grand Maester Pycelle : Let me see you out, my dear.

Ros : lt's all right. No need.

Grand Maester Pycelle : Yes, yes. Till the next time. Right.

Varys : When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?

Petyr Baelish : lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.

Varys : A man with great ambition and no morals. l wouldn't bet against you.

Petyr Baelish : And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?

Varys : l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.

Petyr Baelish : You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.

Varys : Oh, you can do better than that.

Petyr Baelish : When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered.

Varys : Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?

Petyr Baelish : l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?

Varys : l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.

Petyr Baelish : Must be strange for you, even after all these years. a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all.

Varys : Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?

Petyr Baelish : But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.

Varys : And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men - and women.

Petyr Baelish : A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree.

Varys : So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.

Petyr Baelish : Playing our roles.

Varys : Serving a new King.

Petyr Baelish : Long may he reign. My king.

Varys : My king.

Joffrey Lannister : My lords. Shall we begin?

Yoren : You're Arry now, hear me? Arry the orphan boy. No one asks an orphan too many questions, 'cause nobody gives three shits. What's your name?

Arya Stark : Arry.

Yoren : You've a long way to travel, and in bad company. l've 20 this time - men and boys all bound for the Wall. Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and l didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot - half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon. And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself - and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three.

Hot Pie : Watch yourself, midget.

Lommy Greenhands : He's got a sword, this one.

Hot Pie : What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?

Lommy Greenhands : Maybe he's a little squire.

Hot Pie : He ain't no squire. Look at him. He looks like a girl. l bet he stole that sword.

Lommy Greenhands : Let's have a look.

Hot Pie : l could use me a sword like that.

Lommy Greenhands : Take it off him.

Hot Pie : Give it here, midget.

Lommy Greenhands : Look at him! You'd better give Hot Pie the sword. l've seen him kick a boy to death.

Hot Pie : l knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead. l kicked him all to pieces. You better give me that sword!

Arya Stark : You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.

Gendry Baratheon : Your like picking on the little ones, do you? l've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. When l hit that steel, it sings. Are you gonna sing when l hit you? This is castle-forged steel. Where'd you steal it?

Arya Stark : lt was a gift.

Gendry Baratheon : lt don't matter now. Where we're going, they don't care what you've done. They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen, murderers.

Arya Stark : Which are you?

Gendry Baratheon : Armourer's apprentice. But my master got sick of me, so here l am.

Yoren : Come on, you sorry sons of whores! lt's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall, and winter is coming!

Jeor Mormont : Ham. How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least. You look exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that tiring?

Jon Snow : My friends brought me back.

Jeor Mormont : l didn't say it was your honor.

Jon Snow : They killed my father.

Jeor Mormont : And you're gonna bring him back to life, are you? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?

Jon Snow : No.

Jeor Mormont : When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the lron Throne?

Jeor Mormont : Good. Because l want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.

Jon Snow : Beyond the Wall?

Jeor Mormont : l'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. l mean to find out what's happening. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. l will command them myself. So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow, are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?

Rakharo : ls this your command, Khaleesi?

Jorah Mormont : Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.

Daenerys Targaryen : They were not given to me to sell.

Jorah Mormont : Khaleesi, my Queen, l vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be, but let him go, Khaleesi. l know what you intend. Do not.

Daenerys Targaryen : l must. You don't understand.

Jorah Mormont : Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. l won't watch you burn.

Daenerys Targaryen : ls that what you fear? You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives.

Daenerys Targaryen : Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me.

Mirri Maz Duur : You will not hear me scream.

Daenerys Targaryen : I will. But it is not your screams I want. Only your life.

Jorah Mormont : Blood of my blood.

Joffrey Lannister : Well struck. Well struck, Dog.

Joffrey Lannister : Did you like that?

Sansa Stark : It was well struck, Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : I already said it was well struck.

Sansa Stark : Yes, Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : Who's next?

Announcer : Lothor Brune, freerider in the service of Lord Baelish.

Announcer : Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.

Announcer : Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!

Ser Dontos : Here I am. . Here I am. . Sorry, Your Grace. . My deepest apologies. .

Joffrey Lannister : Are you drunk?

Ser Dontos : No. Uh, no, Your Grace. I had - I had two cups of wine.

Joffrey Lannister : Two cups? . That's not much at all. . Please, have another cup.

Ser Dontos : Are you sure, Your Grace?

Joffrey Lannister : Yes, to celebrate my name day. Have two, have as much as you like.

Ser Dontos : I would be honored, Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day. See that he drinks his fill.

Sansa Stark : You can't!

Joffrey Lannister : What did you say? Did you say I can't?

Sansa Stark : I only meant. it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.

Joffrey Lannister : What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...

Sandor Clegane : The girl is right. What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year.

Joffrey Lannister : Take him away. I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.

Sansa Stark : He is. A fool - you're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.

Joffrey Lannister : Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos? . From this day, , you'll be my new fool.

Ser Dontos : Thank you, Your Grace. . And you, My Lady, thank you.

Tyrion Lannister : Beloved nephew.

Tyrion Lannister : We looked for you on the battlefield. . You were nowhere to be found.

Joffrey Lannister : I've been here, ruling the kingdoms.

Tyrion Lannister : What a fine job you've done. . Look at you. . More beautiful than ever. . And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. . This one doesn't like me.

Bronn : Can't imagine why.

Joffrey Lannister : We heard you were dead.

Myrcella : I'm glad you're not dead.

Tyrion Lannister : Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. . My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss.

Joffrey Lannister : Her loss? Her father was a confessed traitor!

Tyrion Lannister : But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.

Sansa Stark : My father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course you are.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, , enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done.

Joffrey Lannister : What work? . Why are you here?

Pycelle : The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning, Your Grace. The conclave has met, , considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done, at last. The longest summer in living memory.

Varys : The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter.

Pycelle : A common superstition.

Petyr Baelish : We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, , we'll have fewer peasants.

Janos : The city's drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war. We have nowhere to house them, and with winter coming, it'll only get worse.

Cersei Lannister : You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?

Janos : I do, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : And are you not a Lord at my command?

Janos : I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital.

Janos : Yes, Your Grace.

Tyrion Lannister : Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. . War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on.

Cersei Lannister : What are you doing here?

Tyrion Lannister : It's been a remarkable journey. I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. . I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for.

Cersei Lannister : What are you doing here? This is the small council.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings.

Cersei Lannister : Our father is Hand of the King.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, but in his absence.

Varys : Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights -

Cersei Lannister : Out! All of you out. . I would like to know how you tricked father into this.

Tyrion Lannister : If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. .

Cersei Lannister : I've done nothing.

Tyrion Lannister : Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.

Cersei Lannister : I tried to stop it.

Tyrion Lannister : Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.

Cersei Lannister : Robb Stark is a child.

Tyrion Lannister : Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?

Cersei Lannister : What do you know about warfare?

Tyrion Lannister : Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.

Cersei Lannister : Joffrey is King.

Tyrion Lannister : Joffrey is King.

Cersei Lannister : You are here to advise him.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back.

Cersei Lannister : How?

Tyrion Lannister : You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.

Cersei Lannister : One.

Tyrion Lannister : One?

Cersei Lannister : Arya, little animal, she disappeared.

Tyrion Lannister : Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child.

Lord : My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons.

Lord : The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. And the Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.

Luwin : Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.

Lord : Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war.

Bran Stark : King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it.

Lord : Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men.

Bran Stark : Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?

Lord : Of course I remember!

Luwin : We can spare four masons for a week, My Lord. Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?

Lord : I - I believe it will.

Luwin : We didn't want him here all day, did we?

Bran Stark : I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.

Luwin : Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. . Lord Portan.

Portan : My Lord, may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons.

Osha : Boil this for an hour and drink the tea. Makes all your pain go away.

Bran Stark : Don't have any pain.

Osha : Lucky for you.

Bran Stark : That way.

Osha : You've been having those dreams again.

Bran Stark : I don't dream.

Osha : Everyone dreams.

Bran Stark : I don't. Heard some of the men talking about the comet. . They say it's an omen. They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.

Osha : Did they? . I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father.

Osha : The stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy. Dragons.

Bran Stark : The dragons are all dead. They've been dead for centuries.

Doreah : What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?

Daenerys Targaryen : He said they ate meat.

Doreah : He didn't tell you what kind of meat?

Daenerys Targaryen : My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.

Daenerys Targaryen : She was Drogo's first gift to me.

Jorah Mormont : I remember.

Daenerys Targaryen : I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?

Jorah Mormont : A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.

Daenerys Targaryen : Does it ever end?

Jorah Mormont : This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste.

Daenerys Targaryen : And you're sure there's no other way?

Jorah Mormont : If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons.

Daenerys Targaryen : No one will take my dragons.

Jorah Mormont : They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength.

Daenerys Targaryen : As you are mine.

Daenerys Targaryen : Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast.

Rakharo : What do we seek, Khaleesi?

Daenerys Targaryen : Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side.

Daenerys Targaryen : Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood.

Rakharo : I will not fail you, blood of my blood.

Daenerys Targaryen : You never have.

Rakharo : This is. bad time to start.

Jon Snow : Having a rough time of it?

Sam : Nothing's killed me yet.

Grenn : Your ass killed the sledge.

Sam : You offered me a ride!

Grenn : I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.

Edd : I was born in a place like this. Later, I fell on hard times.

Sam : Are those girls?

Edd : Craster's daughters.

Sam : I haven't seen a girl in six months.

Edd : I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.

Grenn : What, he don't like people messing with his daughters?

Edd : He don't like people messing with his wives.

Edd : He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters, and on, and on it goes.

Sam : That's foul.

Grenn : It's beyond foul.

Edd : All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right.

Jon Snow : What happens to the boys?

Sam : Hmm?

Jon Snow : He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?

Lord Mormont : He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.

Craster : People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. . Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that.

Jon Snow : We're not Southerners.

Craster : Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name?

Jon Snow : Jon Snow.

Craster : Snow, eh? Listen to me, bastard. All you lot from south of the Wall, you're Southerners. But now you're in the North, the real North.

Lord Mormont : The lad meant no harm.

Craster : I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters -

Lord Mormont : No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word. Now, sit down and shut your mouth.

Craster : You bring any of that good wine with you?

Lord Mormont : We did. We passed through six villages on the way here. All six were abandoned. Where have all the wildlings gone?

Craster : I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.

Lord Mormont : There's a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge. Bring it in here.

Watchman : Yes, commander.

Craster : You want to know where they've all gone? North! To join up with Mance Rayder Your old friend.

Lord Mormont : He's no friend of mine. He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers!

Craster : Oh, aye. But once he was just a poor black crow. And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall.

Lord Mormont : He's been calling himself that for years. What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?

Craster : That's a good-looking axe. Fresh forged?

Lord Mormont : Give it here.

Lord Mormont : You'll have another one made at Castle Black. . Here.

Craster : Oh, that's some lovely steel. . You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing? Gathering an army. What I hear, he's already got more men than any of your southern kings.

Lord Mormont : And where does he plan marching this army?

Craster : When you're all the way north, there's only one direction to go.

Lord Mormont : These are bad times to be living alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising.

Craster : Let them come. My roots are sunk deep. Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are.

Gilly : This is our place. Our husband keeps us safe. Better to live free than die a slave.

Craster : Don't it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?

Lord Mormont : We chose different paths.

Craster : Oh, aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it. . You'll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs.

Lord Mormont : A roof would be welcome. It's been hard riding. We've brought our own food and good steel for you.

Craster : Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand. And I see this one, , staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out.

Lord Mormont : Your roof, your rules.

Lord Mormont : Who am I? Who am I?

Jon Snow : Lord commander.

Lord Mormont : And who are you?

Lord Mormont : Who are you?

Jon Snow : Your steward.

Lord Mormont : You want to lead one day? . Then learn how to follow.

Melisandre : Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness. We offer you these false Gods.

Melisandre : Take them and cast your light upon us. For the night is dark and full of terrors.

Group : For the night is dark and full of terrors.

Melisandre : After the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world. Stars will bleed.

Cressen : We need to stop her!

Melisandre : The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas.

Davos : Not now.

Melisandre : And the dead shall rise in the North.

Cressen : All you men were named in the Light of the Seven! Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers? Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?

Melisandre : You smell of fear, fear and piss and old bones. Do you want to stop me? Stop me.

Melisandre : In the ancient books, it's written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire. And that sword shall be Lightbringer. Stannis Baratheon, warrior of light, your sword awaits you.

Crowd : Lord, cast your light upon us!

Melisandre : For the night is dark and full of terrors.

Stannis Baratheon : For the night is dark and full of terror.

Cressen : This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.

Davos : Stannis is our king. We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path.

Cressen : King. Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation.

Davos : I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.

Cressen : As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths. He's surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos. . If you tell him the truth.

Davos : What's the truth?

Matthos : And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert le"-�

Stannis Baratheon : He wasn't my beloved brother. . I didn't love him, he didn't love me.

Davos : A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : A lie. Take it out.

Matthos : That my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs; the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella, being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth "-

Stannis Baratheon : Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Call him what he is.

Matthos : And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim -

Stannis Baratheon : Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.

Matthos : Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros. . Let all true men declare their loyalty."�

Stannis Baratheon : When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.

Davos : Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother -

Stannis Baratheon : I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.

Davos : Well, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.

Melisandre : Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support. The Lord of Light stands behind him.

Davos : And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

Melisandre : He has no need for ships.

Davos : I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark.

Stannis Baratheon : Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom. I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.

Cressen : I owe you an apology, my King. My duty is to serve. You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods. May the Lord of Light watch over us all. Shall we drink together?

Davos : Don't.

Cressen : A cup of wine to honor the one true God.

Melisandre : The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away. Your Grace.

Jaime Lannister : King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl.

Robb Stark : If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, "Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem."�

Jaime Lannister : You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?

Robb Stark : Oh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours.

Jaime Lannister : Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called 'boy'? Insulted?

Robb Stark : You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy.

Robb Stark : You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. . Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. . He's your bastard son.

Jaime Lannister : If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him.

Robb Stark : My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.

Jaime Lannister : I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.

Robb Stark : Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.

Jaime Lannister : You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?

Robb Stark : I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.

Jaime Lannister : You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.

Robb Stark : No, but he's starting to know me.

Jaime Lannister : Three victories don't make you a conqueror.

Robb Stark : It's better than three defeats.

Shae : This city stinks Like dead bodies.

Tyrion Lannister : A bit corpsey, yes.

Shae : And shit.

Tyrion Lannister : I thought you wanted to come here.

Shae : I love it.

Tyrion Lannister : You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?

Shae : And cum and garlic and rum.

Tyrion Lannister : You can smell cum from the balcony?

Shae : I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck.

Tyrion Lannister : And so did the country.

Shae : This is where I belong.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here.

Shae : No one will know.

Tyrion Lannister : You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars.

Shae : What about you?

Tyrion Lannister : Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.

Shae : Truth? You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.

Tyrion Lannister : Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, , crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.

Tyrion Lannister : Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here.

Cersei Lannister : Lord Baelish.

Petyr Baelish : Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

Petyr Baelish : Of course, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.

Petyr Baelish : If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination.

Cersei Lannister : And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.

Petyr Baelish : Curious.

Cersei Lannister : If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts.

Petyr Baelish : Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. Who knows what they want?

Cersei Lannister : A mockingbird. . You created your own Sigil, didn't you?

Petyr Baelish : Yes.

Cersei Lannister : Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.

Petyr Baelish : I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.

Cersei Lannister : I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another.

Petyr Baelish : When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found.

Cersei Lannister : And which truth is that?

Petyr Baelish : Knowledge is power.

Cersei Lannister : Seize him. . Cut his throat. . Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. . Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. . Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.

Robb Stark : You're Ser Alton Lannister?

Alton : I am, Your Grace.

Robb Stark : I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals.

Alton : An honorable request, Your Grace.

Robb Stark : Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.

Ser Rodrik : The King in the North.

Others At Table : King in the North.

Robb Stark : Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.

Alton : These are... Your Grace, these are...

Robb Stark : These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead.

Alton : King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.

Robb Stark : Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight.

Theon Greyjoy : A word, Your Grace?

Robb Stark : You don't have to call me 'Your Grace' when no one's around.

Theon Greyjoy : It's not so bad once you get used to it.

Robb Stark : I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.

Theon Greyjoy : The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?

Robb Stark : Of course they are.

Theon Greyjoy : We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.

Robb Stark : Men who fought my father.

Theon Greyjoy : Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together.

Catelyn Stark : You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

Robb Stark : I need his ships. They say he has 200.

Catelyn Stark : They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?

Robb Stark : I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.

Catelyn Stark : I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.

Robb Stark : Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another.

Catelyn Stark : I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten.

Robb Stark : If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet.

Catelyn Stark : You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?

Robb Stark : It's more complicated than that! You know it is.

Catelyn Stark : It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.

Robb Stark : You can't go to Winterfell.

Catelyn Stark : I beg your pardon?

Robb Stark : I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, 'cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

Catelyn Stark : Why in the name of all the Gods -

Robb Stark : Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family.

Catelyn Stark : I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -

Robb Stark : Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good.

Catelyn Stark : I will ride at first light.

Robb Stark : We will all be together again soon, I promise.

Catelyn Stark : You've done so well. Your father would be proud.

Robb Stark : Give Lord Renly my regards.

Catelyn Stark : King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.

Cersei Lannister : What is all this?

Joffrey Lannister : Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.

Cersei Lannister : We can't find Arya Stark.

Joffrey Lannister : With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.

Cersei Lannister : Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.

Joffrey Lannister : I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. .

Cersei Lannister : We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -

Joffrey Lannister : The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.

Cersei Lannister : His life is in danger.

Joffrey Lannister : We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.

Cersei Lannister : Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.

Joffrey Lannister : It's not a claim. The throne is mine.

Cersei Lannister : Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -

Joffrey Lannister : Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?

Cersei Lannister : What are you asking?

Joffrey Lannister : I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -

Joffrey Lannister : What you just did is punishable by death. You will never do it again. Never. . That will be all, Mother.

Roz : No, no, no, no. Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Ease into it. Slowly, with passion.

Roz : Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on. Both of you are working tonight.

Roz : We do things differently here, Daisy. This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

Daisy : Haystack Hall.

Roz : Wherever you're from. Our establishment doesn't cater to ploughmen and goat herders. . Lord Olsen. Taste is everything here.

Daisy : Littlefinger's a fancy man.

Roz : Don't call him Littlefinger, he doesn't like it. Lord Baelish.

Roz : She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic. She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.

Daisy : She's beautiful.

Roz : She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot. . Lord Commander. Good to see you, again.

Roz : You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin. Coin which goes in many pockets.

Janos : Orders.

Roz : Whose orders?

Janos : Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.

Mhaegan : No, you can't!

Mhaegan : No! Please! No! Not my Barra! Please. Please.

Janos : Enough. Get it done. Kill the bastard.

Janos : Give it here.

Gold Cloak : Spread out! Search every house, every room. Look in every room.

Blacksmith : Gendry! His name is Gendry.

Janos : Where is the bastard?

Blacksmith : The Night's Watch! Please, stop!

Janos : Where?

Blacksmith : They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north!

Janos : How will we know him?

Blacksmith : He's got a bull's head helmet. He made it himself.

Janos : Find him.

Cold : OPEN

Cersei Lannister : What are you doing here?

Varys : Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as hand in his stead.

Tyrion Lannister : You brought this on yourself.

Cersei Lannister : I've done nothing.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you understand we're losing the war?

Daenerys Targaryen : Does it ever end?

Jorah Mormont : Everything ends, even the red waste.

Daenerys Targaryen : Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.. Take our remaining horses. Find out how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side.

Edd : All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here.

Craster : Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand.

Edd : He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters.

Jon Snow : What happens to the boys? What does he do with his sons?

Matthos : My brother Robert left no trueborn heirs, the boy Joffrey being born of incest between Cersei Lannister, and her brother Jaime Lannister. By right of birth, and blood, I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros.

Stannis Baratheon : Send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm.

Robb Stark : I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.

Jaime Lannister : You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.

Theon Greyjoy : We won't beat them until we take King's Landing, and we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships, and men who know how to sail them.

Robb Stark : Men who fought my father.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me.

Catelyn Stark : You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

Robb Stark : I need his ships.

Catelyn Stark : He is not trustworthy!

Joffrey Lannister : I heard a disgusting lie about uncle Jaime. and you. Father had other children?

Cersei Lannister : What are you asking?

Joffrey Lannister : How many bastards does he have running around?

Janos : Where is the bastard?

Blacksmith : The Night's Watch! Heading North!

End : COLD OPEN

Title : SEQUENCE

Jaqen Hghar : Boy.

Jaqen Hghar : Lovely boy.

Arya Stark : What do you want?

Jaqen Hghar : A man has a thirst. The man does not drink for a day and a night. A boy could make a friend.

Arya Stark : I have friends.

Rorge : Give us a beer. Before I skin you.

Jaqen Hghar : A man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. . You're called Arry. . This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar. Once of the Free City of Lorath.

Rorge : Hey, you little shit. Get us beer!

Arya Stark : You should have asked nicely.

Rorge : Come closer. And I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.

Jaqen Hghar : The boy has more courage than sense.

Rorge : Come here!

Gendry Baratheon : Yoren said none of us were should go near of those three.

Arya Stark : They don't scare me.

Gendry Baratheon : Hmm? Then you're stupid. They scare me.

Arya Stark : What are gold cloaks doing this far from King's Landing?

Gendry Baratheon : What are you doing?

Arya Stark : They're looking for me.

Gold Cloak : You're in command here?

Yoren : You're a long way from home.

Gold Cloak : I asked you a question.

Yoren : Aye, you did. You asked without manners. And I chose not to answer.

Gold Cloak : I have a royal warrant. For one of these gutter rats you're transporting.

Yoren : Well the thing is, , these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now. That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens.

Yoren : It's a funny thing. People worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low. Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast. I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to. Or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it.

Yoren : We'll just keep that. Good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice. You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home. Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.

Gold Cloak : We're looking for a boy named Gendry. . He carries a bull's head helmet. Anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward. We'll be back. With more men. And I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.

Varys : My lord.

Shae : You make me wait a long time, but your friend keeps me company.

Varys : We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.

Tyrion Lannister : It was quite a battle.

Varys : I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.

Shae : And I tell him the story of how we meet.

Varys : To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.

Tyrion Lannister : Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.

Shae : I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.

Varys : How can you tell?

Shae : I can always tell.

Tyrion Lannister : Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. .

Varys : I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends.

Tyrion Lannister : Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned.

Varys : How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. . Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't like threats.

Varys : Who threatened you?

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.

Varys : Ned Stark was a man of honor.

Tyrion Lannister : And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.

Varys : You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.

Cersei Lannister : From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North."� . He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that.

Tyrion Lannister : You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith.

Cersei Lannister : You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?

Alton : I will, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?

Alton : I did. They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten.

Tyrion Lannister : Safe travels, cousin.

Tyrion Lannister : You have a deft hand with diplomacy.

Cersei Lannister : If that's everything?

Pycelle : A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.

Varys : Trouble with the wildlings?

Petyr Baelish : That's why they're called wildlings.

Varys : Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.

Cersei Lannister : Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count.

Tyrion Lannister : Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.

Cersei Lannister : Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.

Tyrion Lannister : Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them.

Pycelle : The northerners are a superstitious people.

Tyrion Lannister : According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. . Mormont doesn't lie.

Varys : How do you kill a dead man?

Tyrion Lannister : Apparently you burn him.

Cersei Lannister : One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. .

Tyrion Lannister : I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall.

Cersei Lannister : I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.

Edd : Then I said, if the gods wanted us to have dignity, wouldn't make us fart when we died.

Grenn : We fart when we die?

Edd : My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world. She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.

Sam : Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?

Edd : We were having a serious discussion.

Grenn : Would you look at that.

Sam : Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.

Grenn : I prefer watching them come towards me.

Sam : I'm sure that's nice too.

Grenn : Well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up. And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old. And then we got older, the wrestling, uh, , changed.

Sam : You were with her? How many times?

Grenn : Well, as many times as I could.

Sam : Wish I'd grew up on a farm.

Edd : We need more potatoes. And get another sack for the sludge. . Get the turnips too.

Sam Tarly : No. Ghost, no. No. Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo! . You all right? Did he frighten you?

Gilly : You shouldn't touch me.

Sam : Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. .

Gilly : You're very brave.

Jon Snow : What're you doing?

Sam : This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters.

Jon Snow : Hello, Gilly. What're you doing?

Gilly : Sam said you could help.

Jon Snow : I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -

Sam : She's pregnant. . We have to take her with us, when we leave.

Jon Snow : What? .

Sam : I know it sounds a bit mad.

Jon Snow : No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible.

Sam : The Lord Commander, , we are sworn to protect -

Jon Snow : Sam we can't take her -

Gilly : Please sir, please. I can still run if I have to.

Jon Snow : It's just not possible.

Gilly : I'm going to have a baby, if it's a boy I.

Jon Snow : If it's a boy what? . You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why.

Sam : Why did you do that?

Jon Snow : Do what, ask her a question?

Sam : You were cruel.

Jon Snow : Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?

Sam : I didn't touch her!

Jon Snow : No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?

Sam : I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat.

Jon Snow : We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?

Sam : I could try. . What? I've read about it. A bit.

Jon Snow : I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her.

Jorah Mormont : Khaleesi.

Jorah Mormont : You don't need to see this.

Daenerys Targaryen : He is blood of my blood.

Daenerys Targaryen : Who did this?

Jorah Mormont : Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar.

Daenerys Targaryen : They will like it far less when I'm done with them.

Irri : No! They killed his soul!

Daenerys Targaryen : Shh. They cannot kill his soul.

Irri : They did! They butchered him like an animal. They did not burn his body. . He can never join his ancestors in the night lands.

Daenerys Targaryen : Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.

Daenerys Targaryen : And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.

Woman : Is it as you remember my lord?

Theon Greyjoy : Looks smaller.

Woman : Everything looks bigger when you're a child. I remember my father's cabin, felt like a palace when I was little. Now look at it.

Theon Greyjoy : They'll be waiting for me on the docks.

Woman : Who will?

Theon Greyjoy : Anyone who matters, , this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet.

Woman : I love the cold and wet.

Theon Greyjoy : They say hard places breed hard men, , and hard men rule the world.

Woman : Then you'll be king before long.

Theon Greyjoy : Try smiling with your lips closed. . Hmm, better.

Woman : My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.

Theon Greyjoy : I don't blame him.

Woman : He says that you're all reavers and rapers. And that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be satis-

Theon Greyjoy : Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture.

Woman : Capture me! Take me with you when you go ashore. Make me your saltwife.

Theon Greyjoy : Your place is on this ship.

Woman : Not after you leave. Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.

Theon Greyjoy : I haven't paid you.

Man : I barely touched her. And you charge twice as much as every other brothel. And this is what I get, crying.

Petyr Baelish : One moment, my friend. A moment.

Petyr Baelish : Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you.

Roz : I'm sorry, my lord.

Petyr Baelish : Shhh. Did he hurt you?

Roz : No, my lord. It's Mhaegen.

Petyr Baelish : Who?

Roz : She works for you. She's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby.

Petyr Baelish : Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace.

Roz : Can't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep. Her poor little baby.

Petyr Baelish : You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. . Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child. I'll see you tomorrow. But you'll be happy? . That makes me happy.

Podrick : More wine?

Janos : Damn it, boy!

Podrick : Apologies, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine.

Janos : Is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.

Tyrion Lannister : Myself, I prefer the improper ones.

Janos : Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?

Tyrion Lannister : You know your wines, my lord.

Janos : That I do. A fine dinner, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord.

Janos : Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.

Tyrion Lannister : Wars have been started for less.

Tyrion Lannister : I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

Janos : Hmm. Nasty business, had to be done.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies.

Janos : Orders are orders.

Tyrion Lannister : Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.

Janos : I never said they were the queen's orders.

Tyrion Lannister : No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman.

Janos : You know your sister better than I do.

Tyrion Lannister : You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.

Janos : I don't listen to filth.

Tyrion Lannister : That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children.

Janos : Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. .

Tyrion Lannister : I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.

Janos : I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.

Tyrion Lannister : The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.

Janos : Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence.

Janos : You think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf.

Tyrion Lannister : Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here.

Tyrion Lannister : I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.

Janos : What are you ta- My friends at court will not allow this. The queen herself -

Tyrion Lannister : The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.

Janos : We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.

Tyrion Lannister : No, we shan't.

Tyrion Lannister : There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way.

Bronn : The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.

Janos : These men are under my command. . I command you to arrest this cutthroat.

Tyrion Lannister : His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.

Bronn : Boys?

Janos : I have friends at court! Powerful friends! The king himself made me a lord!

Tyrion Lannister : To the new Commander.

Tyrion Lannister : If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?

Bronn : Without question? No. I'd ask how much.

Lommy : If they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want. I don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle.

Hot Pie : I'm not afraid of no battles.

Arya Stark : If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants.

Hot Pie : I've seen lots of battles. I saw -

Arya Stark : Liar.

Hot Pie : I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck.

Lommy : Two men fighting isn't a battle.

Hot Pie : They had armor on.

Arya Stark : So?

Hot Pie : So, if they got armor on, it's a battle.

Lommy : No, it isn't.

Hot Pie : What's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?

Arya Stark : Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle.

Hot Pie : It's when they've got armor on.

Gendry Baratheon : Now who told you that.

Hot Pie : A knight?

Gendry Baratheon : How'd you know he was a knight?

Hot Pie : Well, cause he got armor on.

Gendry Baratheon : You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. .

Hot Pie : How'd you know?

Gendry Baratheon : Cause I sold armor.

Arya Stark : What do the gold cloaks want with you?

Gendry Baratheon : No idea.

Arya Stark : You're a liar.

Gendry Baratheon : You shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.

Arya Stark : Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. .

Gendry Baratheon : Well, I don't care what any of them want. No goodo s ever come of their questions.

Arya Stark : No goodo s ever come? Who asked questions before?

Gendry Baratheon : How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?

Arya Stark : Who asked questions?

Gendry Baratheon : The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died.

Arya Stark : Lord Stark.

Gendry Baratheon : See? Asking me questions is bad luck. . You'll probably be dead soon.

Arya Stark : What did they ask about?

Gendry Baratheon : My mom.

Arya Stark : Who's your mom?

Gendry Baratheon : Just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.

Arya Stark : And who was your father?

Gendry Baratheon : He could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway? You thought they were after you, why? Did you kill someone, or is it just because you're a girl?

Arya Stark : I'm not a girl!

Gendry Baratheon : Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?

Arya Stark : Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that.

Gendry Baratheon : That's true. You're still a girl.

Arya Stark : I am not!

Gendry Baratheon : Well, pull your cock out and take a piss then.

Arya Stark : I don't need to take a piss. Lommy and Hot Pie can't know. No one can know.

Gendry Baratheon : They won't. Not from me.

Arya Stark : My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.

Gendry Baratheon : He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.

Arya Stark : He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.

Gendry Baratheon : So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.

Arya Stark : No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -

Gendry Baratheon : You were a lordo s daughter and you lived in a castle. Look, all that about cocks. I should never have said that. I've been pissing in front of you and everything. I should be calling you milady.

Arya Stark : Do not call me milady.

Gendry Baratheon : As milady commands. . Well, that was unladylike.

Man : What you carrying?

Theon Greyjoy : Pears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. . The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. . Me.

Man : Don't like wine. Woman's drink. .

Theon Greyjoy : I need to get to Pyke.

Man : I'll find you a horse.

Yara Greyjoy : I'm heading that way. I can take you there.

Theon Greyjoy : I bet you can.

Yara Greyjoy : You been at sea long? Or were there just no women where you came from?

Theon Greyjoy : None like you.

Yara Greyjoy : You don't know what I'm like.

Theon Greyjoy : You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?

Yara Greyjoy : You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry. Lord Greyjoy.

Theon Greyjoy : Have my things sent up to the castle.

Theon Greyjoy : You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years.

Yara Greyjoy : Nine years. Do you still know your way around a ship? Have these hands ever touched a rope?

Theon Greyjoy : Don't you worry about my hands. . The sea's in my blood.

Yara Greyjoy : Your blood will be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.

Theon Greyjoy : I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky.

Yara Greyjoy : Is that an offer from my future king?

Theon Greyjoy : An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night.

Yara Greyjoy : I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.

Theon Greyjoy : Father.

Balon : Nine years, is it? They took a frightened boy. What have they given back?

Theon Greyjoy : A man. Your blood and your heir.

Balon : We shall see. Stark had you longer than I did.

Theon Greyjoy : Lord Stark is gone.

Balon : And how do you feel about that?

Theon Greyjoy : What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.

Balon : Who gave you those clothes? . Was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?

Theon Greyjoy : If my clothes offend you, I will change them.

Balon : It will. . That bauble around your neck. Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold? . I asked a question. Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes? Iron or gold?

Theon Greyjoy : Gold.

Balon : I'll not have my son dressed as a whore. . My fears have come true. The Starks have made you theirs.

Theon Greyjoy : My blood is salt and iron.

Balon : Yet, , the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message.

Theon Greyjoy : The offer he makes, is one I proposed.

Balon : He heeds your counsel?

Theon Greyjoy : I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother.

Balon : No, not here, , not in my hearing, you will not name him brother. This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?

Theon Greyjoy : I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.

Balon : I see. I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again.

Theon Greyjoy : I will lead the attack myself.

Balon : Oh, you will?

Theon Greyjoy : I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?

Theon Greyjoy : I told you to wait outside. . How did you get past the guards?

Yara Greyjoy : Anything with a cock is easy to fool.

Balon : My dear.

Theon Greyjoy : Yara?

Yara Greyjoy : So good to see you, brother. This is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about.

Theon Greyjoy : She can't lead an attack!

Balon : And why not?

Theon Greyjoy : You're a woman!

Yara Greyjoy : You're the one in skirts.

Balon : This isn't Winterfell, boy. Your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him.

All Three : What's dead may never die.

Balon : No man gives me a crown. I pay the iron price. I will take my crown. . That is who I am. That is who we have always been.

Theon Greyjoy : You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.

Balon : Who said anything about the Lannisters?

Davos : You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.

Saan : All these kings fighting for the throne, and this Stannis has the smallest army. Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance?

Davos : Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey.

Saan : And yet, they both have larger armies.

Davos : Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.

Saan : What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.

Matthos : Mind your words, pirate. .

Davos : Matthos.

Saan : You think I'm insulted? I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.

Davos : Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them.

Saan : That's a promise that always comes true.

Davos : As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong

Saan : Only the clever ones.

Davos : You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing.

Saan : Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.

Davos : It is. .

Saan : One thing, I want the queen.

Davos : The queen?

Saan : Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well.

Matthos : This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.

Saan : I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her.

Matthos : As if she would just let you!

Saan : You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you.

Matthos : Stannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light. The one true god.

Saan : I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs.

Saan : I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.

Davos : He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.

Matthos : You believe your king can win?

Davos : He is the one true king.

Saan : You Westerosee are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. . I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You are the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich.

Davos : Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.

Matthos : When will the King have a sail?

Davos : As soon as his God wills it.

Matthos : He's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. . Let me teach you how to read.

Davos : Oh you and your mother.

Matthos : It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.

Davos : I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!

Matthos : But you always came home.

Davos : I wasn't praying.

Matthos : But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you.

Davos : You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis.

Matthos : Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.

Davos : Don't tell him that.

Cersei Lannister : Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.

Tyrion Lannister : I have every right. I am the King's Hand.

Cersei Lannister : You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.

Tyrion Lannister : Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?

Cersei Lannister : Ha, the people. You think I care?

Tyrion Lannister : You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, "The Queen slaughters babies."� . You don't even have the decency to deny it.

Tyrion Lannister : It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse.

Cersei Lannister : He did what needed to be done. . You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that.

Cersei Lannister : I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. . It's all fallen on me.

Tyrion Lannister : As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon.

Cersei Lannister : You're funny. . You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death.

Tyrion Lannister : She was my mother too.

Cersei Lannister : Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. .

Davos : Your Grace.

Matthos : Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : How did it fare with your pirate?

Davos : Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.

Stannis Baratheon : In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.

Davos : Does seem the wiser choice.

Stannis Baratheon : It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?

Davos : Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him.

Stannis Baratheon : Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us.

Davos : At once, Your Grace.

Melisandre : The Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior.

Davos : Come.

Stannis Baratheon : What did you say to him?

Melisandre : I told him death by fire is the purest death.

Stannis Baratheon : Why?

Melisandre : Because it is true. You're troubled my king.

Stannis Baratheon : Yeah.

Melisandre : These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.

Stannis Baratheon : Tell your lord to burn them then.

Melisandre : I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.

Stannis Baratheon : My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.

Melisandre : You must have faith.

Stannis Baratheon : Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten.

Melisandre : Then we must be the ten.

Stannis Baratheon : I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole.

Melisandre : I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light.

Stannis Baratheon : I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols.

Melisandre : You must give... all of yourself.

Stannis Baratheon : I have a wife. I took a vow.

Melisandre : She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. . I will give you a son, my King.

Stannis Baratheon : A son?

Craster : Out, all of you.

Craster : This bastardo s been meddling where he shouldn't!

Craster : I want you and your men gone. And you will make this right.

Jeor : Wait outside.

Jon Snow : Lord Commander-

Jeor : Now!

Sam : Lord Commander-

Jeor : Leave us.

Jeor : What did you do?

Jon Snow : I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn.

Jeor : What business is that of yours?

Jon Snow : No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys...

Jon Snow : You know.

Jeor : Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings.

Jon Snow : Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.

Jeor : Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight, out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster.

Jon Snow : I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child.

Jeor : Yeah. Whatever it was, I daresay you'll see it again. Now, ready my horse. We leave at dawn.

Jeor : Don't lose it again.

Sam : Gilly.

Gilly : You're leaving.

Sam : I, I wanted to give you something. It belonged to my mother.

Gilly : I can't take it.

Sam : Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.

Gilly : You, you shouldn't give it away.

Sam : I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you.

Sam : Keep it safe for me. Til I come back.

Hodor : Hodor.

Luwin : Hodor. Rouse Bran, will you? It's time for his lessons.

Bran Stark : Every night it's the same.

Bran Stark : I'm walking and running, but I'm not I'm not me. I'm running through the godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves.

Luwin : That's exactly what they are, Bran - stories.

Bran Stark : So she was lying? They don't exist?

Luwin : Well, they may have done. But they're gone from the world, along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more.

Bran Stark : No, my dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father dying. And Rickon had the same dream.

Luwin : What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? Right.

Luwin : This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one maester in a hundred wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on.

Luwin : All right. Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world. But not anymore. The dragons are gone. The giants are dead. And the Children of the Forest forgotten.

Margaery Tyrell : Loras! Highgarden!

Man : Get him!

Crowd : Oh!

Loras : Yield! I yield.

Renly : Well fought. Approach.

Renly : Rise. Remove your helm.

Renly : You are all your father promised and more, my lady. I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion.

Margaery Tyrell : Now, now, my love. My brother fought valiantly for you.

Renly : That he did, my queen. But there can only be one champion. Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire. If it is within my power, it is yours.

Brienne : Your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard.

Loras : What?

Brienne : I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm.

Renly : Done. Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.

Colen : Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell.

Catelyn Stark : Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.

Renly : Lady Catelyn. I'm pleased to see you. May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell?

Margaery Tyrell : You are very welcome here, Lady Stark. I'm so sorry for your loss.

Catelyn Stark : You are most kind.

Renly : My lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husbando s murder. When I take King's Landing, I'll bring you Joffrey's head.

Catelyn Stark : It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord.

Brienne : Your Grace. And you should kneel when you approach the King.

Renly : There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest.

Loras : Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?

Catelyn Stark : I do not sit on my son's war councils. And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you.

Loras : If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother's skirts.

Catelyn Stark : My son is fighting a war, not playing at one.

Renly : Don't worry, my lady. Our war is just beginning.

Gerard : Your Grace.

Renly : Gerard. How's your foot?

Gerard : Better, Your Grace.

Gerard : They don't know their own size is all.

Renly : Good man.

Renly : I have a hundred thousand men at my command. All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.

Catelyn Stark : And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? I pity them.

Renly : Why?

Catelyn Stark : Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.

Renly : Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent. She's tired from her journey.

Brienne : At once, Your Grace. Shall I return after?

Renly : That won't be necessary. I would pray awhile. Alone.

Brienne : If you'll follow me, my lady.

Catelyn Stark : You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.

Brienne : I fought for my king. Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. And, if it please you, Brienne's enough. I'm no lady.

Theon Greyjoy : What are you doing here?

Yara Greyjoy : I live here. Are you angry with me, brother?

Theon Greyjoy : You lying bitch.

Yara Greyjoy : It's not my fault you didn't recognize me.

Theon Greyjoy : Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you- you looked like a fat little boy.

Yara Greyjoy : You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you.

Theon Greyjoy : Why didn't you tell me?

Yara Greyjoy : I wanted to see who you were first. And I did.

Balon : The plans are made. It's time you heard them.

Yara Greyjoy : Father.

Theon Greyjoy : Father.

Balon : The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The Ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall.

Balon : Yara, my daughter, you'll take thirty longships to attack Deepwood Motte.

Yara Greyjoy : I've always wanted a castle.

Theon Greyjoy : And what's my role in all this?

Balon : You'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.

Theon Greyjoy : A ship? You give her thirty and I get one?

Yara Greyjoy : The Sea Bitch. We thought she'd be perfect for you.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm to fight fishermen?

Yara Greyjoy : Be careful of their nets.

Theon Greyjoy : Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily.

Yara Greyjoy : They won't even know we're there until it's too late.

Theon Greyjoy : What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior.

Balon : Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock.

Balon : What are our words? Our words?

Theon Greyjoy : We do not sow.

Balon : We do not sow. We are Ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.

Theon Greyjoy : You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?

Theon Greyjoy : You gave me away!

Theon Greyjoy : Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.

Yara Greyjoy : You'd have our father bow down to your other family?

Theon Greyjoy : I have no other family.

Yara Greyjoy : Don't you? Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly. Our ships sail with or without you.

Shae : You won't let me leave this room. You won't let me-

Tyrion Lannister : Keep your voice down.

Shae : Why? You think your father can hear me? He's three hundred miles away!

Tyrion Lannister : I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.

Tyrion Lannister : Again, only temporary.

Shae : Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.

Tyrion Lannister : But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.

Shae : Scullion? What is a scullion?

Tyrion Lannister : Kitchen wench.

Shae : A kitchen wench?

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, but-

Shae : Cleaning pots? Is that how my lion wants to see me?

Tyrion Lannister : Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.

Shae : I'm the weakness?

Tyrion Lannister : It's a compliment, my lady.

Shae : How is being a weakness a compliment?

Tyrion Lannister : Language can be a bit tricky here.

Shae : Oh, I'm too stupid to understand. The stupid foreign girl. I am not a kitchen wench.

Myrcella : When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?

Cersei Lannister : Soon, darling, when the war is over.

Myrcella : Mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast. But yours will be ivory, since you're the bride.

Cersei Lannister : The princess just spoke to you.

Sansa Stark : Pardon, Your Grace. I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods.

Tommen Lannister : Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?

Cersei Lannister : He might.

Cersei Lannister : Would you like that?

Tommen Lannister : No. I don't think so.

Cersei Lannister : Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?

Sansa Stark : Come in.

Sansa Stark : Who are you?

Shae : I'm Shae, my lady. Your new handmaiden.

Sansa Stark : I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. You're not from here.

Shae : No.

Sansa Stark : What are you doing?

Shae : Waiting for you to tell me what to do.

Sansa Stark : I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.

Shae : What things?

Sansa Stark : Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.

Sansa Stark : No.

Shae : You said to brush your-

Sansa Stark : Not now.

Shae : Your chamber pot is empty.

Sansa Stark : Clean the table.

Sansa Stark : Have you ever been a handmaiden before?

Shae : Yes.

Sansa Stark : For whom?

Shae : Lady Zuriff.

Sansa Stark : Lady Zuriff

Sansa Stark : There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.

Shae : She wasn't in this city.

Sansa Stark : I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job.

Shae : Do you want me to leave?

Sansa Stark : Just brush my hair.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.

Pycelle : I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily.

Tyrion Lannister : Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.

Tyrion Lannister : Please.

Pycelle : Thank you, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?

Pycelle : Why, yes, of course, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.

Pycelle : Matrimony, huh? Yes.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake.

Pycelle : Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it.

Pycelle : Myrcella sent away to Dorne?

Tyrion Lannister : But remember, the Queen mustn't know.

Varys : Ooh. "The Queen mustn't know." I love conversations that begin this way.

Tyrion Lannister : I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.

Varys : Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark.

Tyrion Lannister : Precisely.

Tyrion Lannister : Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.

Tyrion Lannister : But remember, you must tell no one.

Petyr Baelish : Tell no one what?

Tyrion Lannister : I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.

Petyr Baelish : She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?

Tyrion Lannister : For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?

Petyr Baelish : And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?

Tyrion Lannister : Who better?

Petyr Baelish : Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?

Tyrion Lannister : The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal.

Petyr Baelish : Harrenhal is cursed.

Tyrion Lannister : Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.

Petyr Baelish : With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm.

Tyrion Lannister : You served my family well in the matter of the succession.

Petyr Baelish : So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away.

Tyrion Lannister : I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?

Tyrion Lannister : Good. Oh. And remember-

Petyr Baelish : The Queen mustn't know.

Renly : That must hurt.

Renly : What? What is it?

Loras : A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.

Renly : Brienne is a very capable warrior.

Renly : And she's devoted to me. You're jealous.

Loras : Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.

Renly : I'll make it up to you.

Loras : No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone.

Loras : Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.

Renly : And Margaery's a virgin?

Loras : Officially. Shall I bring her to you?

Renly : I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine.

Margaery Tyrell : As is your right. You are a king.

Renly : You look very beautiful.

Margaery Tyrell : Thank you, Your Grace.

Renly : It's a lovely gown.

Margaery Tyrell : You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way.

Renly : You certainly don't need it.

Renly : Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed.

Renly : Must be the wine.

Margaery Tyrell : Here, let me.

Renly : I'm sorry.

Margaery Tyrell : Do you want my brother to come in and help?

Renly : What?

Margaery Tyrell : He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.

Renly : I don't know what you're talking about.

Margaery Tyrell : There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.

Margaery Tyrell : Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like.

Margaery Tyrell : Whatever you need to do. You are a king.

Cersei Lannister : You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?

Tyrion Lannister : Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.

Cersei Lannister : I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.

Tyrion Lannister : Dorne is the safest place for her.

Cersei Lannister : Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.

Tyrion Lannister : That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.

Cersei Lannister : She'll be a hostage.

Tyrion Lannister : A guest.

Cersei Lannister : You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.

Tyrion Lannister : It's done, Cersei.

Cersei Lannister : No.

Tyrion Lannister : You cannot stop it.

Cersei Lannister : No!

Tyrion Lannister : Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.

Cersei Lannister : Get out! Get out!

Priest : Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?

Theon Greyjoy : I would.

Drowned Priest : Kneel.

Drowned Priest : Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel.

Theon Greyjoy : What is dead may never die.

Drowned Priest : What is dead may never die. But rises again harder and stronger. Stand.

Petyr Baelish : I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?

Tyrion Lannister : No, afraid not. Sorry about that.

Petyr Baelish : And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.

Petyr Baelish : Leave me out of your next deception.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in.

Petyr Baelish : Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.

Tyrion Lannister : No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?

Tyrion Lannister : Find him?

Bronn : Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt.

Tyrion Lannister : No, you don't.

Bronn : No, I don't.

Pycelle : What is the meaning of this?

Pycelle : No, please, please.

Tyrion Lannister : You disappoint me, Grand Maester.

Pycelle : I am your loyal servant.

Tyrion Lannister : So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.

Pycelle : No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider.

Tyrion Lannister : See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you.

Pycelle : The eunuch has spies everywhere.

Tyrion Lannister : Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.

Pycelle : No, no, no.

Timett : There are no goats, halfman.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, make do.

Tyrion Lannister : How long have you been spying for my sister?

Pycelle : All I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father, ask him. I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't like his beard.

Pycelle : What? What?

Pycelle : Oh, no. No.

Tyrion Lannister : How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?

Pycelle : Oh, Lord Arryn, h-he knew. He, he knew the t-truth about, about, about the Queen. An-And he planned to act, to t-tell King Robert.

Tyrion Lannister : So you poisoned him?

Pycelle : No. Never.

Tyrion Lannister : But you let him die, made sure he succumbed.

Pycelle : Lannister, I always served Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister : Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.

Pycelle : Oh, no. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me!

Tyrion Lannister : For your trouble.

Varys : You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.

Tyrion Lannister : Good. One of my better ideas.

Varys : And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?

Varys : Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day.

Tyrion Lannister : The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.

Varys : Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?

Tyrion Lannister : Why, am I about to hear one?

Varys : Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?

Tyrion Lannister : Depends on the sellsword.

Varys : Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.

Tyrion Lannister : He has a sword, the power of life and death.

Varys : But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?

Tyrion Lannister : I've decided I don't like riddles.

Varys : Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.

Yoren : You should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a long march. Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us.

Arya Stark : I can't sleep.

Arya Stark : I don't like the taste.

Yoren : Well... You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest.

Yoren : What?

Arya Stark : How do you sleep?

Yoren : Same as most men, I think.

Arya Stark : But you've seen things, horrible things.

Yoren : Aye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many.

Arya Stark : How do you sleep when you... when you have those things in your head?

Yoren : You didn't see that. I made damn sure.

Arya Stark : I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and... and my sister.

Yoren : You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lado s name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?

Yoren : Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves.

Gendry Baratheon : Get up.

Arya Stark : Get up.

Yoren : Keep out of sight, both of you.

Arya Stark : No, I'm not afraid.

Gendry Baratheon : I can fight.

Yoren : Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back.

Yoren : Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now!

Man : Come on, move, move!

Guard : It's got to be the Mountain. He's the biggest. He's the strongest.

Rennick : Bulls are bigger than lions. Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.

Guard : If the bull had fangs and claws, I would. Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime.

Rennick : If he ever gets out.

Guard : Loras Tyrell?

Rennick : Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.

Guard : I don't care about pretty. He's better with a sword than any of them.

Rennick : How good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead.

Rennick : The horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses.

Guard : They get spooked by their own shadows.

Rennick : Shh. Do you hear that?

Guard : No.

Rennick : There's something out there.

Guard : Oh. Oh, you're a right little prick. You should see your face.

Rennick : I swear you pissed yourself. "Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"

Guard : There is something out there.

Rennick : Yeah, don't even try me.

Guard : Rennick.

Rennick : Do you think I'm an idiot?

Guard : Rennick!

Man : King in the North!

Men : The King in the North!

Roose Bolton : Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours. They're dead. Take everything they've got. We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners. Barely enough food to feed our own.

Robb Stark : We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.

Roose Bolton : Of course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans.

Robb Stark : I doubt it.

Roose Bolton : Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say, "A naked man has few secrets. "A flayed man none."

Robb Stark : My father outlawed flaying in the North.

Roose Bolton : We're not in the North.

Robb Stark : We're not torturing them.

Roose Bolton : The high roado s very pretty, but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it.

Robb Stark : The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own. I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.

Wounded Soldier : No, don't! Don't! Please!

Talisa : Shhh.

Talisa : The rot's set in.

Wounded Soldier : No, don't! No, don't!

Talisa : Shh.

Wounded Soldier : Please, don't! It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt.

Talisa : The rot will spread if we don't take the foot now

Wounded Soldier : No, you can't!

Wounded Soldier : Ser! Please, ser. I can't lose-

Robb Stark : You'll die if she doesn't.

Wounded Soldier : I don't want to be a cripple, please.

Roose Bolton : Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.

Talisa : Your men are not my men, my lord.

Robb Stark : Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.

Wounded Soldier : No! You can't!

Robb Stark : Bite on it. It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me.

Robb Stark : What's your name?

Talisa : Talisa.

Robb Stark : Your last name?

Talisa : You want to know what side my family fights on?

Robb Stark : You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.

Talisa : That boy lost his foot on your orders.

Robb Stark : They killed my father.

Talisa : That boy did?

Robb Stark : The family he fights for.

Talisa : Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.

Robb Stark : I have no hatred for the lad.

Talisa : That should help his foot grow back.

Robb Stark : You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey.

Talisa : You're going to kill Joffrey?

Robb Stark : If the gods give me strength.

Talisa : And then what?

Robb Stark : I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.

Talisa : So who will?

Robb Stark : I don't know.

Talisa : You're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?

Robb Stark : First we have to win the war.

Robb Stark : You never told me where you're from.

Talisa : Volantis.

Robb Stark : Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.

Talisa : He was unlucky that you were.

Joffrey Lannister : You're here to answer for your brother's latest treasons.

Sansa Stark : Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you, please

Joffrey Lannister : Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage.

Lancel : Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. Thousands of good men were butchered. After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain.

Joffrey Lannister : Killing you would send your brother a message.

Joffrey Lannister : But my mother insists on keeping you alive. Stand. So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way. Meryn.

Joffrey Lannister : Leave her face. I like her pretty.

Joffrey Lannister : Meryn, my lady is overdressed. Unburden her.

Joffrey Lannister : If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we're going to have to speak louder.

Tyrion Lannister : What is the meaning of this?

Tyrion Lannister : What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?

Meryn : The kind who serves his king, Imp.

Bronn : Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak.

Tyrion Lannister : Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?

Joffrey Lannister : I'm punishing her.

Tyrion Lannister : For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit.

Joffrey Lannister : You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!

Tyrion Lannister : The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?

Meryn : No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?

Tyrion Lannister : I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?

Sansa Stark : I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love.

Tyrion Lannister : Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.

Bronn : The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.

Tyrion Lannister : You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?

Bronn : There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.

Joffrey Lannister : What are you doing here, dog?

Sandor Clegane : Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it.

Joffrey Lannister : And? What is it?

Sandor Clegane : Look inside, Your Grace.

Daisy : Your Grace.

Ros : Happy nameday, Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : My nameday has passed.

Ros : We won't tell if you won't.

Joffrey Lannister : No. Her. Touch her.

Joffrey Lannister : Could you hit her?

Joffrey Lannister : My uncle sent you?

Daisy : Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself.

Ros : Hmm.

Joffrey Lannister : Use this.

Joffrey Lannister : Harder.

Joffrey Lannister : I said harder. He'd want me to get his money's worth.

Ros : Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure.

Daisy : Please, Your Grace.

Ros : Your Grace, if your uncle finds out

Joffrey Lannister : Oh, I want him to find out. You will bring her to his chambers when you're finished and show him what you've done, or the same thing will happen to you.

Joffrey Lannister : Begin.

Joffrey Lannister : Harder!

Renly : Well, if it isn't my favorite whoremonger. Pray I haven't kept you waiting long.

Petyr Baelish : Your Grace.

Renly : Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron?

Petyr Baelish : I'm a practical man.

Renly : Just not a loyal one.

Petyr Baelish : And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?

Renly : I don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here?

Renly : You can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge.

Petyr Baelish : You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim.

Renly : Now I understand. You know I have the numbers. You know I'm marching on King's Landing. When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position. And your head.

Petyr Baelish : I would give priority to my head.

Petyr Baelish : I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates.

Margaery Tyrell : Lord Baelish.

Petyr Baelish : All of these tents look the same to me. Would you be so kind-

Margaery Tyrell : It would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again.

Petyr Baelish : Your tent"? Not "Our tent"? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne.

Margaery Tyrell : I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers.

Petyr Baelish : If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now.

Margaery Tyrell : The place of a Kingsguard is by the king's side.

Petyr Baelish : And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?

Margaery Tyrell : You seem quite interested in our marriage.

Petyr Baelish : Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else.

Margaery Tyrell : You've never married, have you?

Petyr Baelish : I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.

Margaery Tyrell : That is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my king, and my king is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night.

Daenerys Targaryen : This isn't your horse.

Kovarro : It was given to me by the Thirteen. The Elders of Qarth.

Daenerys Targaryen : Qarth?

Kovarro : Three days to the east, on the sea.

Daenerys Targaryen : Will they let us in?

Kovarro : They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons.

Daenerys Targaryen : What do you know of this place?

Jorah Mormont : Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones. Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows.

Man : Go on!

Man : You, keep moving!

Man : Bring her about!

Hot Pie : What kind of fire melts stone?

Arya Stark : Dragonfire.

Hot Pie : There's dragons here?

Gendry Baratheon : No, all the dragons are dead.

Hot Pie : What's that smell?

Arya Stark : Dead people.

Soldier : Move.

Man : Please, please, no, no! No.

Woman : He's dead. He was my son. My sister was three days ago. My husband, the day before that.

Gendry Baratheon : They take someone every day?

Arya Stark : Does anyone live?

Arya Stark : Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.

Catelyn Stark : How dare you?

Petyr Baelish : You may have heard false reports.

Catelyn Stark : You betrayed Ned.

Petyr Baelish : Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment.

Catelyn Stark : I trusted you. My husband trusted you. And you repaid our faith with treachery.

Petyr Baelish : No, my lady.

Catelyn Stark : Get out!

Petyr Baelish : Cat, I've I've loved you since I was a boy. It seems to me that fate has given us this chance

Catelyn Stark : Have you lost your mind? Get out!

Petyr Baelish : Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?

Catelyn Stark : You have Arya, too?

Petyr Baelish : Both girls are healthy and safe. For now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.

Catelyn Stark : What do you want?

Petyr Baelish : The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.

Catelyn Stark : Of course they will. Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms.

Petyr Baelish : I'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you.

Catelyn Stark : You think I keep secrets from my son?

Petyr Baelish : Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift.

Catelyn Stark : I don't want your gifts. A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill. He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith.

Catelyn Stark : Good faith?

Catelyn Stark : What's this?

Petyr Baelish : Your husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. You may not believe

Catelyn Stark : Get out.

Man : Get up, you dogs!

Hot Pie : That's him, the one who picks.

Arya Stark : The Mountain. What are you doing?

Hot Pie : He told me he stares at him every day. That's why he doesn't get picked.

Mountain : You.

Soldier : Move, boy! Move!

Tickler : Is there gold and silver in the village?

Prisoner : I don't know.

Tickler : Gems?

Prisoner : I didn't see any.

Tickler : Where is the Brotherhood?

Prisoner : I don't know. Please.

Tickler : Which of the villagers aided them?

Tickler : Who?

Prisoner : I-

Prisoner : I never saw. Please. Please, stop. Please, it's starting to-

Prisoner : I didn't see anyone help him. Take it off! Take it off!

Tickler : Who helped him?

Prisoner : Ganes, the butcher, and his son.

Tickler : That's better. You've been very helpful.

Prisoner : No, stop, please! What are you doing? Please, stop! Please, stop!

Prisoner : No! No! I told you everything! No! No!

Arya Stark : Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.

Woman : Please, Polliver. Some food. Just a crust of bread.

Arya Stark : Polliver. The Mountain.

Stannis Baratheon : Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands.

Catelyn Stark : I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis.

Renly : Can that truly be you?

Stannis Baratheon : Who else might it be?

Renly : When I saw your standard, I couldn't be sure. Whose banner is that?

Stannis Baratheon : My own.

Renly : I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing. Why is your stag on fire?

Melisandre : The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.

Renly : Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about. Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age.

Stannis Baratheon : Watch yourself, Renly.

Renly : No, no, I'm relieved. I never really believed you were a fanatic. Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man.

Melisandre : You should kneel before your brother. He's the Lordo s chosen, born amidst salt and smoke.

Renly : Born amidst salt and smoke? Is he a ham?

Stannis Baratheon : That's twice I've warned you.

Catelyn Stark : Listen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers.

Stannis Baratheon : It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddardo s integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me.

Catelyn Stark : We share a common enemy.

Stannis Baratheon : The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.

Renly : The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall. Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother's wombs. No one wants you for their king. You never wanted any friends, brother. But a man without friends is a man without power.

Stannis Baratheon : For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you.

Renly : Look across those fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?

Stannis Baratheon : You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?

Renly : No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.

Stannis Baratheon : We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see.

Melisandre : Look to your sins, Lord Renly. The night is dark and full of terrors.

Renly : Would you believe I loved him once?

Daenerys Targaryen : I thought we were welcome.

Jorah Mormont : If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : Horde?

Daenerys Targaryen : My name is Daenerys-

Spice King : Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.

Daenerys Targaryen : You know me, my lord?

Spice King : Only by reputation, Khaleesi. And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons.

Daenerys Targaryen : And what should I call you?

Spice King : Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be.

Daenerys Targaryen : The beauty of Quarth is legendary-

Spice : KING Qarth.

Daenerys Targaryen : Qarth.

Spice King : Might we see the dragons?

Daenerys Targaryen : My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored

Spice King : Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.

Daenerys Targaryen : I am not a liar.

Spice King : Oh, I don't think you are. But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value.

Daenerys Targaryen : Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates.

Spice King : Then perhaps you should return to where you come from. We wish you well.

Daenerys Targaryen : What are you doing? You promised to receive me.

Spice King : We have received you. Here we are, and here you are.

Daenerys Targaryen : If you do not let us in, all of us will die.

Spice King : Which we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.

Jorah Mormont : Khaleesi, please be careful.

Daenerys Targaryen : Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first.

Spice King : Ah. You are a true Targaryen. Only, as you said a moment ago, if we don't let you into the city, you will all die. And so-

Xaro : Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.

Spice King : The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The Thirteen have spoken.

Xaro : I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking.

Spice King : The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine? She is the Mother of Dragons.

Xaro : Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands.

Spice King : Our decision is final.

Xaro : Very well. I invoke soumai.

Xaro : I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law.

Spice King : Be it on your head.

Xaro : Welcome to Qarth, my lady.

Tickler : Is there gold or silver in the village?

Gendry Baratheon : I'm not from the village.

Gendry Baratheon : I don't know what that is.

Man : You two. Take Lord Lannister's things to his quarters.

Tywin Lannister : What's this?

Mountain : We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

Tywin Lannister : Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?

Mountain : Cells are overflowing, my lord.

Polliver : This lot won't be here long. Don't need no permanent place. After we interrogate 'em, we usually just-

Tywin Lannister : Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?

Tywin Lannister : You, do you have a trade?

Gendry Baratheon : Smith, my lord.

Polliver : What are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.

Tywin Lannister : He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?

Arya Stark : Safer to travel, my lord.

Tywin Lannister : Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer.

Mountain : My lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Your visits are too few, cousin.

Lancel : Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle. Here's your warrant.

Tyrion Lannister : So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.

Lancel : I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp.

Tyrion Lannister : If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?

Lancel : I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately.

Tyrion Lannister : And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?

Lancel : As I said several times.

Tyrion Lannister : And you've waited this long to deliver the information?

Lancel : When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay.

Tyrion Lannister : Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf.

Lancel : The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn.

Tyrion Lannister : She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.

Lancel : I am a knight!

Tyrion Lannister : An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?

Lancel : You will withdraw these filthy accusations.

Tyrion Lannister : Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?

Lancel : It's not my fault!

Tyrion Lannister : Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?

Lancel : Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything.

Tyrion Lannister : Did he tell you to fuck her, too?

Lancel : I only meant I did as I was bid.

Tyrion Lannister : Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.

Lancel : Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you.

Tyrion Lannister : Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.

Lancel : My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear.

Tyrion Lannister : No, I think not.

Lancel : My lord?

Tyrion Lannister : You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me.

Lancel : Yes, my lord, I will. I swear it, as you command.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent.

Lancel : But her demands?

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

Lancel : You will?

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length.

Davos : Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : Do your knuckle bones bring you luck?

Davos : Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean.

Stannis Baratheon : Fewer.

Davos : Pardon?

Stannis Baratheon : Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.

Davos : It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.

Stannis Baratheon : You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good.

Davos : A lesson I've tried to teach my son.

Stannis Baratheon : Does he listen?

Davos : To me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest

Stannis Baratheon : She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.

Davos : I've lived within the law for seventeen-

Stannis Baratheon : I want you to be a smuggler this time.

Davos : Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?

Stannis Baratheon : The Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.

Davos : I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.

Stannis Baratheon : Cleaner ways don't win wars.

Melisandre : Are you afraid, Onion Knight?

Davos : Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.

Melisandre : You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?

Davos : I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad.

Melisandre : If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil.

Davos : And which are you?

Melisandre : Oh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life.

Davos : Well, that must be very nice for you.

Melisandre : Do you love your wife?

Davos : I do.

Melisandre : Yet you have known other women.

Davos : Don't talk about my wife.

Melisandre : I'm not. I'm talking about other women. Like me, Ser Davos. You want me. You want to see what's beneath this robe.

Melisandre : And you will.

Davos : Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.

Melisandre : Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are.

Davos : These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.

Melisandre : They can't bar our passage.

Davos : Gods protect us.

Melisandre : There's only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him.

Renly : You swear it?

Catelyn Stark : By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.

Renly : Then I see no reason for hostility between us. Your son can go on calling himself King in the North. The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty.

Catelyn Stark : And the wording of this oath?

Renly : The same Ned Stark swore to Robert eighteen years ago. Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together.

Catelyn Stark : And in return for my son's loyalty?

Renly : In the morning, I'll destroy my brother's army.

Renly : When that's done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before.

Catelyn Stark : Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother.

Renly : Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind.

Renly : Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight.

Brienne : No! No.

Soldier : Follow me!

Soldier : You'll die for this.

Catelyn Stark : No, wait, it wasn't her!

Catelyn Stark : We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.

Man : Inside the king's tent - go

Man : Now.

Brienne : I won't leave him.

Catelyn Stark : You can't avenge him if you're dead.

Man : Over there, go!

Brienne : Not that way.

Margaery Tyrell : We need to go home. Loras.

Petyr Baelish : My lord, my lady.

Loras : Get out.

Petyr Baelish : Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king.

Loras : And you want that privilege for yourself.

Petyr Baelish : You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis.

Margaery Tyrell : There's no time for this.

Loras : Ride back to Highgarden, sister. I'm not running from Stannis.

Margaery Tyrell : Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.

Loras : I don't believe that. You don't believe that. Who gained the most from our king's death?

Petyr Baelish : Stannis.

Loras : I will put a sword through his righteous face.

Margaery Tyrell : You can't stay here.

Loras : He would have been a true king, a good king.

Petyr Baelish : Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?

Loras : Revenge.

Petyr Baelish : I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it.

Margaery Tyrell : You can't avenge him from the grave. Bring the horses. Please.

Margaery Tyrell : He was very handsome.

Petyr Baelish : He was, Your Grace.

Margaery Tyrell : Your Grace." Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen.

Petyr Baelish : Do you want to be a queen?

Margaery Tyrell : No. I want to be the queen.

Cersei Lannister : Killed? By whom?

Tyrion Lannister : Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.

Cersei Lannister : Really? Who'd have thought?

Tyrion Lannister : Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour.

Cersei Lannister : Whomever did it, I say well done.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea.

Cersei Lannister : Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.

Tyrion Lannister : And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later.

Cersei Lannister : Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?

Tyrion Lannister : She'll be safer in Dorne.

Cersei Lannister : Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety.

Tyrion Lannister : It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you.

Cersei Lannister : So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?

Tyrion Lannister : Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.

Cersei Lannister : No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.

Tyrion Lannister : May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?

Cersei Lannister : You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same.

Tyrion Lannister : It's important that we talk about this.

Cersei Lannister : It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.

Lancel : It's wildfire.

Tyrion Lannister : Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?

Lancel : No.

Tyrion Lannister : MThat's a lie right there.

Lancel : It is not a lie. Why would I lie?

Tyrion Lannister : Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.

Lancel : I'm telling you the truth.

Tyrion Lannister : The smart money would be on more likely.

Lancel : She's making wildfire.

Tyrion Lannister : But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.

Lancel : The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.

Tyrion Lannister : I suppose there's only one way to find out.

Lancel : They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please.

Tyrion Lannister : When did she tell you this?

Lancel : I heard her talking with the pyromancer. And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you.

Tyrion Lannister : Swear to me on what?

Lancel : On my life.

Tyrion Lannister : But I don't care about your life.

Lancel : In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow...

Tyrion Lannister : All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me.

Lancel : Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.

Bronn : It will be my pleasure.

Davos : Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : What is it?

Davos : I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him.

Stannis Baratheon : Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be.

Davos : I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.

Stannis Baratheon : I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.

Davos : Your Grace, I-

Stannis Baratheon : I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.

Davos : And I've never known you to hide from the truth.

Stannis Baratheon : You've come to lecture me on truth?

Davos : I've come to tell you that what I saw.

Stannis Baratheon : All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.

Davos : Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron

Stannis Baratheon : I'll hear no more about it.

Man : Take a company of men, secure the perimeter.

Davos : When do we sail for King's Landing?

Stannis Baratheon : As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city.

Davos : And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?

Stannis Baratheon : That's not your concern.

Davos : If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers.

Stannis Baratheon : I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?

Davos : Loyal service means telling hard truths.

Stannis Baratheon : Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?

Davos : She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.

Stannis Baratheon : What do you believe?

Davos : You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.

Stannis Baratheon : We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.

Davos : Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy.

Stannis Baratheon : Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.

Girl : I've got it! I've got it!

Man : So it's that one there at the top, on the right.

Man : Buy my fruit, my lord. Fresh fruit.

Tyrion Lannister : Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?

Bronn : There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it.

Bronn : Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?

Tyrion Lannister : He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.

Protester : Corruption.

Crowd : Yes!

Protester : We are swollen, bloated, foul. Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we're surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten? Yes, a rotten king.

Tyrion Lannister : It's hard to argue with his assessment.

Bronn : Not after what he did to your birthday present.

Tyrion Lannister : The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.

Man : A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.

Tyrion Lannister : You have to admire his imagination.

Bronn : He's talking about you.

Tyrion Lannister : What? Demon monkey?

Bronn : People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.

Tyrion Lannister : Blame me? I'm trying to save them.

Bronn : You don't need to convince me.

Tyrion Lannister : Demon monkey.

Man : Yeah, come on.

Theon Greyjoy : You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.

Theon Greyjoy : Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!

Black Lorren : Where are we headed, Captain?

Theon Greyjoy : The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well.

Black Lorren : And who decides if we've done our jobs well?

Theon Greyjoy : I do. Your captain.

Black Lorren : I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon's balls, Captain. Don't reckon I've got much use for your ideas on how to do it. Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?

Theon Greyjoy : You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor.

Yara Greyjoy : Stop. We yield.

Yara Greyjoy : Congratulations on your first command.

Theon Greyjoy : Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.

Yara Greyjoy : Oh, I'm not here for you. I was just on my way to Red Harbor. I've got thirty ships. There's nowhere to put them here. Too narrow.

Theon Greyjoy : You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.

Yara Greyjoy : That would never happen. My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to. This lot, though... Enjoy the Stony Shore.

Dagmer : Come on, I'll take you out.

Theon Greyjoy : Who are you?

Dagmer : Dagmer, your first mate.

Theon Greyjoy : Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.

Dagmer : They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.

Theon Greyjoy : And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?

Dagmer : You're not.

Theon Greyjoy : And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.

Dagmer : They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?

Theon Greyjoy : The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.

Dagmer : The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermen's daughters. What, you don't think we could take it?

Theon Greyjoy : No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-

Theon Greyjoy : Take me to my ship.

Reginald : The Starks have overextended their lines. Now that summer's over, they'll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed.

Tywin Lannister : The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.

Amory : Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.

Tywin Lannister : And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?

Reginald : We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep.

Tywin Lannister : Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.

Reginald : My wife's in Lannisport.

Tywin Lannister : Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head.

Tywin Lannister : If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!

Tywin Lannister : Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?

Arya Stark : Maidenpool, my lord.

Tywin Lannister : And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.

Arya Stark : House Mooton, my lord.

Tywin Lannister : And what is their sigil?

Tywin Lannister : A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?

Tywin Lannister : Good. One more time, where are you from?

Arya Stark : Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.

Tywin Lannister : And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?

Arya Stark : They call him the Young Wolf.

Tywin Lannister : And?

Arya Stark : They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.

Tywin Lannister : And do you believe them?

Arya Stark : No, my lord. Anyone can be killed.

Tywin Lannister : Fetch that water.

Jaqen Hghar : A girl says nothing.

Jaqen Hghar : A girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl.

Arya Stark : I was always a girl.

Jaqen Hghar : And I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them.

Arya Stark : You're one of them now. I should have let you burn.

Jaqen Hghar : And you fetch water for one of them now. Why is this right for you and wrong for me?

Arya Stark : I didn't have a choice.

Jaqen Hghar : You did. I did. And here we are.

Jaqen Hghar : A man pays his debts. A man owes three.

Arya Stark : Three what?

Jaqen Hghar : The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl. And only death may pay for life. You saved me and the two I was with. You stole three deaths from the Red God. We have to give them back. Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done.

Arya Stark : I can name anyone and you'll kill him?

Jaqen Hghar : A man has said.

Arya Stark : The one who tortures everyone.

Jaqen Hghar : A man needs a name.

Arya Stark : I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.

Jaqen Hghar : That is enough. Go now, girl. Your master is thirsty.

Jeor : He's not here yet. He'd have seen us, blown the horn.

Jon Snow : When will he come?

Jeor : The Halfhand does things in his own time.

Jon Snow : My uncle told me stories about him.

Jeor : Most of them are true.

Jon Snow : I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.

Jeor : The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw.

Jon Snow : So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.

Jeor : Well, possible for the Halfhand.

Sam : Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here.

Dolorous Edd : There's nothing more sickening than a man in love.

Man : About time you did something. At least you'll keep warm.

Sam : The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men.

Dolorous Edd : Before I die, please, stop talking.

Sam : Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?

Dolorous Edd : Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.

Jon Snow : I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.

Grenn : Wildlings?

Jon Snow : One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.

Dolorous Edd : So you got to stand there waiting, wondering. One blast for friends, two for foes.

Sam : And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times.

Grenn : But if it's been a thousand years, how do you know?

Sam : Well I read it in a book.

Dolorous Edd : I read it in a book.

Jon Snow : Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand.

Dolorous : EDD Aye, we'll live another day. Hurrah.

Haylene : Take care, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, "Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. "

Haylene : Oh, I have not conducted this experiment. It could well be true. The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh. The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow.

Haylene : After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power.

Tyrion Lannister : My companion takes issue.

Bronn : If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.

Haylene : Our order does not deal in pig shit. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.

Bronn : To do what?

Haylene : The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.

Tyrion Lannister : How much do you have?

Bronn : If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father.

Haylene : My lord, this man is insulting.

Bronn : I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down.

Tyrion Lannister : My friend remains unconvinced.

Haylene : He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.

Bronn : Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks.

Haylene : We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both.

Bronn : This is a shit idea.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me.

Daenerys Targaryen : Dracarys. Dracarys.

Daenerys Targaryen : He'll be able to feed himself from now on.

Daenerys Targaryen : Let him sleep, Doreah.

Doreah : Yes, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : He loves you.

Irri : I rewove this part of the top. And I fixed the heel on this one.

Daenerys Targaryen : Thank you, my friend.

Doreah : Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you? They say he's the wealthiest man in Qarth.

Irri : It is known.

Doreah : And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos-

Daenerys Targaryen : The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo.

Irri : May he ride forever through the night lands.

Daenerys Targaryen : Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy.

Doreah : You would look like a real princess in Xaro's-

Irri : She's not a princess. She's a Khaleesi. You should wear it, Khaleesi.

Irri : You are their guest. It would be rude not to.

Woman : And you must visit the night market. The Qartheen night market is like no night market you've ever seen.

Daenerys Targaryen : It sounds wonderful.

Woman : The Meereenis think they have a night market. I will take you there myself.

Daenerys Targaryen : Please excuse me for a moment.

Daenerys Targaryen : What are they doing?

Jorah Mormont : Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry.

Kovarro : Or melt it. Very simple.

Daenerys Targaryen : We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.

Kovarro : Of course not, Khaleesi! We will wait until we leave.

Daenerys Targaryen : Not even when we leave.

Kovarro : Why not?

Daenerys Targaryen : Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.

Daenerys Targaryen : My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.

Jorah Mormont : It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men.

Daenerys Targaryen : That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.

Pyatt Pree : Mother of Dragons. On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you. A demonstration?

Pyatt Pree : Take this gem. Look at it. Into its depths. So many facets. Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them. Often more than once.

Pyatt Pree : Should you grow tired of Xaro's baubles and trinkets, it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying. You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons.

Xaro : My apologies. Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen. It was customary for me to extend him an invitation. Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.

Daenerys Targaryen : What is the House of the Undying?

Xaro : It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening. It turns their lips blue and their minds soft. So soft, they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic.

Quaithe : You watch over her.

Jorah Mormont : Do I know you?

Quaithe : I know you. Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.

Jorah Mormont : Who are you?

Quaithe : I'm no one. But she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors, now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again. And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh. And fire is power.

Brienne : It looked like Stannis.

Catelyn Stark : To me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man.

Brienne : In the shape of Stannis.

Catelyn Stark : We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.

Brienne : Will you stay there long, my lady?

Catelyn Stark : Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long.

Brienne : I never knew my mother.

Catelyn Stark : I'm sorry.

Catelyn Stark : My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.

Brienne : It's a bloody business.

Catelyn Stark : What comes after is even harder.

Brienne : Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?

Catelyn Stark : You mean to kill Stannis.

Brienne : I swore a vow.

Catelyn Stark : But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.

Catelyn Stark : I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.

Catelyn Stark : Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.

Brienne : I only held him that once as he was dying.

Catelyn Stark : He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.

Brienne : I do not know your son, my lady. But I could serve you, if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis.

Catelyn Stark : When the time comes, I will not hold you back.

Brienne : Then I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

Catelyn Stark : I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.

Winterfell Shepherd : And it's not just thieves, my lord. There's wolves in them hills now, more than I ever seen. They come down in the night and they kill my sheep. My three sons is away fighting for your brother, my lord. They'll fight, keep fighting till they're told to go home. I have no one to man my flock now. Only me. I can't keep watch all day and all night.

Bran Stark : We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board.

Winterfell Shepherd : My wife always prayed for more children. We'll look after them. Thank you, my lord. And may the gods bless you and yours.

Bran Stark : Stop it. If that's everyone, I'm going to go for a ride before dark.

Luwin : Good.

Bran Stark : Hodor.

Hodor : Hodor.

Rodrik : Bran! Lord Stark. Torrhen's Square is under siege.

Luwin : Torrhen's Square is barely forty leagues from here. How can the Lannisters strike so far north?

Rodrik : Might be a raiding party led by the Mountain. Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.

Bran Stark : We have to help them.

Rodrik : Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather two hundred decent men.

Luwin : Do you need so many?

Bran Stark : If we can't protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us? Go, Ser Rodrik. Take the men you need.

Rodrik : Won't take long, my lord. Southerners don't do well up here.

Bran Stark : So, what does it mean?

Osha : Ask your Maester Luwin. He's the one studying books all the time.

Bran Stark : I did ask him. He'd never heard of a three-eyed raven.

Osha : Must not mean anything, then.

Bran Stark : You're lying.

Osha : You might be a little lord, but don't you call me a liar.

Bran Stark : You know what it means.

Osha : I never said I didn't.

Bran Stark : You didn't give me an honest answer.

Osha : That's not the same as being a liar.

Bran Stark : Well, it's not far off.

Osha : So, you've been dreaming of a three-eyed raven again? In the godswood, you told me you didn't dream. Now who's a liar? What did you see in your dream?

Osha : Something bad? Tell me, boy.

Bran Stark : I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell. I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls. It flooded the castle. Drowned men were floating here, in the yard. Ser Rodrik was one of them.

Osha : The sea is hundreds of miles away.

Bran Stark : I know. It's just a stupid dream.

Osha : I've got to get these potatoes to the kitchen. Otherwise they'll put me in chains again.

Bran Stark : Osha. The three-eyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall?

Osha : They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall.

Qhorin : There.

Jeor : Where?

Qhorin : On that mountain.

Sam : I don't see very well.

Jon Snow : A fire.

Qhorin : There's a fire. The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine. When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal. Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor.

Jeor : How many wildlings have joined him?

Qhorin : From what we can tell, all of them. Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves. They're almost ready to make their move.

Jon Snow : Where?

Qhorin : Somewhere safe. Somewhere south. Can't just march into their midst. And we can't wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.

Jeor : You saying we should fall back to the Wall?

Qhorin : Mance was one of us once. Now he's one of them. He's going to teach them our way of doing things. They'll hit us in force and they won't run away when we hit back. They're gonna be more organized than before, more disciplined, more like us. So we need to be more like them, do things their way. Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall. And to do that

Jeor : We need to get rid of those lookouts.

Qhorin : It's not a job for 400 men. I need to move fast and silent. Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.

Jon Snow : Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.

Qhorin : I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin. You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.

Jon Snow : I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?

Qhorin : He's the one?

Jeor : Aye. You killed a wight. You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.

Qhorin : Craster? In the boy's defense, that's a tough old goat.

Sam : I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble.

Jeor : Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward. Go on.

Xaro : So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you?

Daenerys Targaryen : He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor and he's my friend.

Xaro : Unlikely. I can almost always tell what a man wants.

Daenerys Targaryen : And what about what a woman wants?

Xaro : Much more complicated. You, for example, what do you want?

Daenerys Targaryen : To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.

Xaro : Why?

Daenerys Targaryen : Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.

Xaro : You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?

Daenerys Targaryen : I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.

Xaro : Ah, a conqueror.

Daenerys Targaryen : And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?

Xaro : No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo.

Daenerys Targaryen : So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious.

Daenerys Targaryen : What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why?

Xaro : I will show you why.

Xaro : The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone. The hardest steel does not make a mark. I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it. I made the same offer to the greatest thieves. They all went home empty-handed. The only thing that can open this door is this key.

Daenerys Targaryen : And behind the door?

Daenerys Targaryen : And it can all be mine?

Xaro : All? Let us say half. More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies. Enough to go home.

Daenerys Targaryen : All I have to do?

Xaro : Is marry me.

Daenerys Targaryen : That was a romantic proposal.

Xaro : I've already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me. I come from nothing. My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes. But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses.

Xaro : See? I have more ambition than you thought. The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name. Robert Baratheon is dead.

Jorah Mormont : If you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it...

Daenerys Targaryen : The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country.

Jorah Mormont : To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros.

Daenerys Targaryen : The usurper is dead.

Daenerys Targaryen : The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other.

Jorah Mormont : According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?

Daenerys Targaryen : The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.

Jorah Mormont : Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way.

Daenerys Targaryen : And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now.

Jorah Mormont : I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have, but you musT-

Daenerys Targaryen : Do not speak to me like I'm a child.

Jorah Mormont : I only want-

Daenerys Targaryen : What do you want? Tell me.

Jorah Mormont : To see you on the Iron Throne.

Daenerys Targaryen : Why?

Jorah Mormont : You have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real.

Daenerys Targaryen : So what would you have me do, as my advisor?

Jorah Mormont : Make your own way. Find your own ship. You only need one. The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.

Daenerys Targaryen : And how do I get the ship?

Jorah Mormont : I'll find it for you. A sound ship with a good captain.

Daenerys Targaryen : I look forward to meeting him.

Jorah Mormont : Khaleesi.

Arya Stark : You should stand sideface.

Gendry Baratheon : Sideface?

Arya Stark : Sideways.

Gendry Baratheon : Why?

Arya Stark : Smaller target.

Gendry Baratheon : Am I fighting someone?

Arya Stark : You're practicing for a fight. You should practice right.

Gold Cloak : Guards! Did you see anything? Go up there. Go and see where he fell from.

Gold Cloak : Go up the battlement.

Woman : That is strange.

Gold Cloak : Move away. Stand back. He's dead.

Theon Greyjoy : I've taken your castle.

Bran Stark : Theon?

Theon Greyjoy : It's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.

Bran Stark : Why?

Theon Greyjoy : To take the castle.

Bran Stark : You went with Robb.

Theon Greyjoy : And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?

Bran Stark : I don't know.

Theon Greyjoy : Find the halfwit.

Theon Greyjoy : My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.

Theon Greyjoy : So you and I can go down and tell them - how you've yielded Winterfell to me.

Bran Stark : I won't.

Theon Greyjoy : Yes, you will.

Bran Stark : I won't. I'll never yield. We'll fight you and throw you out.

Theon Greyjoy : The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say.

Bran Stark : Theon. Did you hate us the whole time?

Bran Stark : I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.

Theon Greyjoy : Louder. Say Prince Theon.

Bran Stark : I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. You all know me.

Farlen : Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit.

Bran Stark : Farlen, you be silent.

Theon Greyjoy : Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do.

Bran Stark : All of you should do as he commands.

Theon Greyjoy : My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects.

Farlen : Bugger that. I serve the Starks. If you think you can hold the North with it-

Ironborn : Shut up!

Theon Greyjoy : If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not?

Luwin : I am.

Theon Greyjoy : I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens.

Luwin : My lord.

Osha : My Lord Greyjoy.

Theon Greyjoy : I see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive.

Osha : You were here the day I was taken.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm the one who took you. What of it?

Osha : Let me serve you.

Theon Greyjoy : Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.

Osha : It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens. Put a spear in my hand again.

Theon Greyjoy : So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.

Osha : Step aside.

Osha : It's your dream, little lord. The ocean has come to swallow this place. I ain't letting it drown me.

Theon Greyjoy : You'll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days' time-

Black Lorren : Greyjoy!

Black Lorren : We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen's Square. Took out two of ours before I got his sword.

Theon Greyjoy : Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes.

Rodrik : It grieves me you've less honor than a back alley whore. You were raised here under this roof. These people are your people.

Theon Greyjoy : They are not my people.

Rodrik : King Robb thought of you as a brother.

Theon Greyjoy : My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you.

Rodrik : Aye, they died fighting a war your father started. Lord Stark raised you among his own sons.

Theon Greyjoy : Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home.

Rodrik : If he were alive to see this

Theon Greyjoy : He's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine.

Rodrik : I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand.

Theon Greyjoy : You've served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I'll-

Theon Greyjoy : Take him to the cells. Lock him up

Dagmer : My prince. You cannot let that stand. He must pay.

Theon Greyjoy : I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.

Dagmer : No, he has to pay the iron price. They'll never respect you while he lives.

Theon Greyjoy : Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death!

Bran Stark : No! You said no harm would come to them if I yielded.

Theon Greyjoy : The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.

Luwin : I urge you not to make a hasty decision.

Theon Greyjoy : He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine.

Luwin : He is worth more to you alive than dead. The Starks will pay. Please, Theon, think what you do.

Theon Greyjoy : You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next.

Dagmer : Come.

Bran Stark : No! No! Theon! Please. Ser Rodrik!

Rodrik : He who passes the sentence should swing the sword.

Bran Stark : I'm begging you.

Rodrik : Coward.

Bran Stark : Stop. Stop! Stop right now!

Theon Greyjoy : You don't give commands anymore, little lord.

Bran Stark : Please, stop this. Please stop him.

Rodrik : Hush now, child. I'm off to see your father.

Bran Stark : You said no harm would come! You said no harm would come. Theon, please.

Theon Greyjoy : Any last words, old man?

Rodrik : Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost.

Bran Stark : Theon, please don't.

Rickon : Do something!

Bran Stark : I'll do anything, please! No, please stop it!

Jon Snow : Ghost, stay with us. Ghost!

Qhorin : There goes your pet.

Jon Snow : He's not a pet.

Qhorin : No, you're right, he's not. You can't tame a wild thing. You can't trust a wild thing.

Jon Snow : Ghost is different.

Qhorin : So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night.

Jon Snow : I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.

Qhorin : I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.

Jon Snow : We could do the same.

Qhorin : No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it.

Jon Snow : My father always said I'm of the North.

Jon Snow : I wasn't joking.

Qhorin : Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me?

Qhorin : No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life.

Jon Snow : I'll gladly give my life.

Qhorin : I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me?

Jon Snow : I do.

Qhorin : You're even dumber than you look. It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night. Make us feel like we've got a purpose. Come on. We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us.

Tywin Lannister : Can you read?

Amory : My lord?

Tywin Lannister : This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.

Amory : My apologies, my lord. I must have-

Tywin Lannister : Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It's the one on this-

Tywin Lannister : My cupbearer can read better than you.

Tywin Lannister : To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?

Armory : My lord, I-

Tywin Lannister : To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have twenty thousand men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us.

Tywin Lannister : Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it.

Guard : Lord Petyr Baelish.

Tywin Lannister : Mmm. Give us the room.

Tywin Lannister : Clear all this.

Petyr Baelish : Lord Tywin.

Tywin Lannister : Baelish.

Tywin Lannister : Wine?

Petyr Baelish : Thank you.

Tywin Lannister : What news from the capital?

Petyr Baelish : I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.

Tywin Lannister : Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear.

Petyr Baelish : So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.

Tywin Lannister : Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.

Petyr Baelish : It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.

Tywin Lannister : You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?

Petyr Baelish : After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers.

Tywin Lannister : Yes, yes, yes.

Petyr Baelish : The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery-

Tywin Lannister : Wants to be queen.

Petyr Baelish : Yes, she does.

Tywin Lannister : House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson.

Petyr Baelish : They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.

Tywin Lannister : More wine for Lord Baelish.

Petyr Baelish : If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement TYWIN

Petyr Baelish : They have.

Arya Stark : Pardon, my lord.

Petyr Baelish : It's only wine.

Tywin Lannister : You would ride there yourself?

Petyr Baelish : Tonight, with your leave.

Tywin Lannister : I'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl.

Tywin Lannister : And what else?

Petyr Baelish : On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark.

Tywin Lannister : Why?

Petyr Baelish : He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.

Tywin Lannister : Hmm.

Jon Snow : A girl.

Qhorin : A wildling.

Jon Snow : We could question her.

Qhorin : You could. She won't answer. I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.

Jon Snow : What's your name?

Ygritte : Ygritte.

Qhorin : She was reaching for this ax when you got to her. Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face.

Ygritte : I gave you my name.

Jon Snow : I'm Jon Snow.

Ygritte : You ought to burn them you killed.

Qhorin : We'd need a big fire for that. Tell me, Ygritte. Why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area?

Ygritte : Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again.

Qhorin : Our boy here's already killed one dead man. He can do it again if he has to. What waits beyond the pass?

Ygritte : The Free Folk.

Qhorin : How many?

Ygritte : Hundreds and thousands. More than you've ever seen, crow.

Qhorin : Why come to the mountains? What's in the Frostfangs your king could want?

Qhorin : Do you mean to march on the Wall?

Qhorin : Do you know who I am, girl?

Ygritte : Qhorin Halfhand.

Qhorin : Tell me true. If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner?

Ygritte : They'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they'd kill you slow.

Qhorin : We have no food for her. Can't spare a man to watch her. Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us. It needs to be done. Want me to do it?

Jon Snow : No. No, I'll do it.

Qhorin : Come, brothers. We'll leave him to it. We'll meet you at the top. Don't take too long. We're deep in their country now.

Ygritte : You never killed a woman before, did you? You don't need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There's secret ways. The crows would never catch us.

Jon Snow : I'm as much a crow as they are.

Ygritte : Will you burn me? After?

Jon Snow : Can't. Someone might see the smoke.

Ygritte : Strike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I'll come back and haunt you. That's cold.

Ygritte : Go on. Be quick about it.

Ygritte : Do it. Bastard, do it!

Ygritte : You can't do it. We both know it.

Ygritte : The sun's going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close.

Jon Snow : I'll find them.

Ygritte : Call for them. Go on. Call loudly.

Septon : May the Seven guide the princess on her journey. May the Mother give her health. May the crone give her wisdom. May the warrior give her courage.

Cersei Lannister : One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you.

Joffrey Lannister : You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother. Princes don't cry.

Sansa Stark : I saw you cry.

Joffrey Lannister : Did you say something, my lady?

Sansa Stark : My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.

Joffrey Lannister : So?

Sansa Stark : It seems a normal thing.

Joffrey Lannister : Is your little brother a prince?

Sansa Stark : No.

Joffrey Lannister : Not really relevant then, is it? Come, dog.

Man : Hail Joffrey! Hail to the King. Seven blessings on you, Your Grace.

Man : Murderer! Bastard!

Man : All hail the King.

Man : He's no king.

Man : He's a bastard!

Man : Please, Your Grace, we're hungry.

Man : Freak.

Tyrion Lannister : Get the Prince back to the Keep now.

Guard : Yes, my lord. Come, quickly.

Woman : Please, Your Grace, give us some food!

Man : Bread, Your Grace, please!

Joffrey Lannister : Who threw that? I want the man who threw that. Find who did that and bring him to me!

Guard : Hold on!

Guard : Hold them back!

Joffrey Lannister : Just kill them! Kill them all!

Tyrion Lannister : Move. Move!

Guard : Pull back!

Man : Tear him to pieces!

Joffrey Lannister : What are you doing? I want these people executed!

Sandor Clegane : And they want the same for you.

Tyrion Lannister : Where's Sansa?

Guard : Through the door.

Guard : Come on.

Guard : Push hard.

Meryn : Protect the king!

Guard : Get back!

Guard : Fall back! Keep him safe!

Guard : Come in! Come in!

Cuard : Keep him safe!

Crowd : Motherfucker! Brotherfucker!

Guard : Watch out. Hold them back.

Man : Hey.

Joffrey Lannister : Traitors! I'll have all their heads.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, you blind, bloody fool!

Joffrey Lannister : You can't insult me.

Tyrion Lannister : We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king.

Joffrey Lannister : You can't-

Tyrion Lannister : I can, I am.

Joffrey Lannister : They attacked me!

Tyrion Lannister : They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool! All because of a war you started.

Joffrey Lannister : You're talking to a king!

Tyrion Lannister : And now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl?

Joffrey Lannister : Let them have her!

Tyrion Lannister : If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back! You owe him quite a bit, you know.

Man : Where are you going?

Man : You ever been fucked, little girl? Come here.

Tyrion Lannister : Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.

Meryn : I take my orders from the king.

Man : Where? This way.

Sansa Stark : Please! No! No!

Man : Please!

Sandor Clegane : You're all right now, little bird. You're all right.

Man : We'll get you.

Man : This way.

Tyrion Lannister : Are you hurt, my lady?

Sandor Clegane : The little birdo s bleeding. Someone take her back to her cage. See to that cut.

Tyrion Lannister : Well done, Clegane.

Sandor Clegane : I didn't do it for you.

Daenerys Targaryen : He shouldn't make me wait.

Xaro : The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth. He makes everyone wait. Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth.

Daenerys Targaryen : I already have a husband.

Xaro : Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi. You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful.

Daenerys Targaryen : And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery.

Xaro : I have traveled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery.

Spice King : The Mother of Dragons!

Xaro : Ah, here he comes.

Spice King : Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night. Terrible dreams. I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing. Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you. I am sorry about all that unpleasantness. The silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself.

Xaro : Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself.

Spice King : Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather. Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I'll have them flogged in the square.

Daenerys Targaryen : Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want.

Spice King : Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want?

Daenerys Targaryen : My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.

Spice King : I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have.

Daenerys Targaryen : I'm not asking you for the kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships.

Spice King : I need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another.

Daenerys Targaryen : Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.

Spice King : Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?

Daenerys Targaryen : My father sat there, before he was murdered.

Spice King : But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say "take the Iron Throne"?

Daenerys Targaryen : I didn't come here to argue grammar.

Spice King : Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess. Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. Do you have an army?

Daenerys Targaryen : Not yet.

Spice King : You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?

Daenerys Targaryen : There are many there that support my claim.

Spice King : When were you there last?

Daenerys Targaryen : I left when I was a baby.

Spice King : So, in truth, you have no allies.

Daenerys Targaryen : The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return.

Spice King : Ah. Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams. Now if you'll pardon me.

Daenerys Targaryen : Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met.

Spice King : A shrewd man.

Daenerys Targaryen : For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons.

Daenerys Targaryen : Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.

Spice King : I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I'm sorry, little princess.

Daenerys Targaryen : I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it.

Spice King : Yes, my lady, but not with my ships.

Tywin Lannister : Who taught you to read?

Arya Stark : My father, my lord.

Tywin Lannister : Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?

Arya Stark : A stonemason.

Tywin Lannister : A stonemason who could read? Hmm.

Arya Stark : He taught himself.

Tywin Lannister : Quite a man. What killed him?

Arya Stark : Loyalty.

Tywin Lannister : You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?

Arya Stark : Did... Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn't ask questions.

Tywin Lannister : No. But you've already begun.

Arya Stark : Did you know your father, my lord?

Tywin Lannister : I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old.

Tywin Lannister : He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I'm cold.

Arya Stark : I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord.

Tywin Lannister : Mmm.

Amory : Where are you going, girl?

Arya Stark : The armory, my lord.

Amory : Why?

Arya Stark : Lord Tywin sent me.

Amory : What might this be?

Arya Stark : Lord Tywin gave it to me.

Amory : What for?

Arya Stark : To take to the armory.

Amory : Why would he do that? Let's go and ask him.

Amory : Move! Get out of the way!

Arya Stark : Amory Lorch.

Jaqen Hghar : A girl has named a second name. A man will do what must be done.

Arya Stark : Now!

Jaqen Hghar : A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing. A man cannot make a thing happen before its time.

Arya Stark : But he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away. It has to be now.

Tywin Lannister : Guard!

Soldier : Your Grace.

Soldier : My honor, Your Grace.

Quent : Your Grace.

Robb Stark : Quent.

Robb Stark : Lady Talisa.

Talisa : Your Grace. I'm not sure I'm a lady. Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me.

Robb Stark : It's hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she's a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows.

Talisa : Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?

Robb Stark : Because it's obvious.

Talisa : What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother, and I lived with him above our shop?

Robb Stark : I'd call you a liar.

Talisa : Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.

Talisa : I always thought I was a brilliant liar.

Robb Stark : Better at amputations, I'm afraid.

Robb Stark : Quite a pretty spot.

Talisa : Will we be here long?

Robb Stark : I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.

Talisa : I'm not a spy.

Robb Stark : Of course, a spy would deny being a spy.

Talisa : You're right. You've found me out. I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters. "The Young Wolf is on the move. "

Robb Stark : Perhaps you'd join me... If you've got time, of course, for, well-

Catelyn Stark : Robb.

Robb Stark : Mother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She's been helping with the wounded. She's been very... helpful.

Catelyn Stark : Lady Talisa.

Talisa : Lady Stark.

Catelyn Stark : Lady Talisa...?

Talisa : Maegyr.

Catelyn Stark : Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name.

Talisa : An uncommon name here. An old name in Volantis. Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace.

Robb Stark : I've missed you.

Catelyn Stark : Yes, you look positively forlorn.

Robb Stark : You surprised me, that's all. I didn't think I'd see you today.

Catelyn Stark : I wish that you were free to follow your heart.

Robb Stark : I know.

Catelyn Stark : You have inherited your father's responsibilities. I'm afraid they come at a cost. You are promised to another.

Catelyn Stark : A debt that must be paid.

Robb Stark : I haven't forgotten.

Roose Bolton : Your Grace. My lady. News from Winterfell.

Ygritte : Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go.

Jon Snow : We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today.

Ygritte : Here? There's no shelter here.

Jon Snow : There's no shelter anywhere.

Ygritte : There is if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. If you light a fire-

Jon Snow : No fire.

Ygritte : But a fire is-

Ygritte : Have it your way.

Ygritte : We'll stay warmer if we stay close.

Ygritte : Bet you freeze to death before I do. Bet your life.

Ygritte : Think they're out looking for you?

Jon Snow : Yes.

Ygritte : Think they'll find you?

Ygritte : You're brave. Stupid, but brave.

Jon Snow : We start again at first light. Get some sleep.

Jon Snow : Stop moving.

Ygritte : I'm just trying to get comfortable.

Jon Snow : Stop it!

Jon Snow : You're still moving.

Ygritte : Was I? I didn't notice that time.

Robb Stark : This cannot be true.

Roose : We've had ravens from White Harbor, Barrowton and the Dreadfort. I'm afraid it is true.

Robb Stark : Why? Why would Theon-

Roose : Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.

Robb Stark : My brothers?

Roose : We've heard nothing of them. But Rodrik Cassel is dead.

Catelyn Stark : I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!

Robb Stark : I must go north at once.

Roose : There's still a war to win, Your Grace.

Robb Stark : How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can't-

Roose : You are a king. And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.

Catelyn Stark : Let me go and talk to Theon.

Robb Stark : There will be no talk. He will die for this.

Roose : Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew. Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort. He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon. We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained. My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head.

Robb Stark : Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself.

Theon Greyjoy : Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?

Osha : I'm no liar.

Theon Greyjoy : All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.

Osha : I done what I had to do to stay alive. I hate the Starks as well as you do. Let me serve you, my lord.

Theon Greyjoy : How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.

Osha : There are other ways to serve, my lord.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm a prince now, and you'd do well-

Ahsa : There are other ways to serve, my prince.

Theon Greyjoy : Like what?

Osha : We know things, the free people.

Theon Greyjoy : You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?

Osha : Other things.

Osha : Savage things.

Theon Greyjoy : Wait outside.

Theon Greyjoy : I always wondered what you had under there.

Osha : It comes at a price.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm not killing you. That's your price.

Osha : I already had that.

Theon Greyjoy : What do you want then, other than your miserable life?

Ahsa : What all free people want. My freedom.

Theon Greyjoy : Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well.

Sansa Stark : Ow!

Shae : Shh. It's not deep.

Sansa Stark : I thought they were going to kill me.

Shae : They thought so, too.

Sansa Stark : He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me.

Shae : Of course he did.

Sansa Stark : Why? Why would a stranger-

Shae : You are everything he will never have. Your horse eats better than his children. It doesn't matter now. He's dead.

Sansa Stark : I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them.

Shae : Don't say these things. If the wrong people hear you-

Sansa Stark : But you're not the wrong people.

Shae : Don't trust anybody. Life is safer that way.

Guard : And where are you going?

Osha : I have something for you from Prince Theon.

Guard : What?

Osha : Me. He says I'm to make the rounds. And keep you warm.

Daenerys Targaryen : The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?

Xaro : When I came to this city, I had nothing. Truly nothing. I slept by the docks. And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat. If not, I dreamed of food. Today, I am the richest man in Qarth. Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable? I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn. And here I am, with no regrets.

Xaro : Bar the gates. Ring the bells. Slowly, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : Where are they? Where are my dragons?

Theon Greyjoy : A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?

Black Lorren : The giant must have took him.

Theon Greyjoy : The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one?

Black Lorren : Gone, along with the wildling woman. The one you were fucking.

Theon Greyjoy : Right. Get the horses and the hounds.

Man : Come on, find the scent. Where they going?

Dagmer : Halt!

Theon Greyjoy : Enjoying your first hunt?

Luwin : So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord.

Theon Greyjoy : With hunting, there's blood at the end.

Luwin : They're little boys.

Theon Greyjoy : I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here. So I kept my word. I never ran away. If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them. Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.

Luwin : Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.

Theon Greyjoy : They have no value to me missing.

Luwin : Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.

Theon Greyjoy : Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte. She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000.

Man : We have a scent!

Theon Greyjoy : The hounds have the scent. Come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game.

Osha : We should have took more food.

Bran Stark : We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.

Osha : Those people all love you. They would have given you whatever you needed.

Bran Stark : And if Theon found out, he'd hang them.

Osha : The boy can't survive on walnuts.

Rickon : I'm fine.

Osha : We've been walking since before sunrise. Even Hodor will tire.

Hodor : Hodor.

Osha : Even you, sweet giant.

Bran Stark : Wait, I know that farm. I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.

Rickon : Jack and Billy. They'll give us some food.

Bran Stark : We can't risk it. If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are.

Rikon : Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.

Osha : You've never seen me climb a tree, little man.

Bran Stark : They'll be after us with hounds.

Osha : We got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever.

Ygritte : Did you pull a knife on me in the night?

Ygritte : What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.

Jon Snow : Let's move.

Ygritte : It is the first time. How old are you, boy?

Jon Snow : I'm a man of the Night's Watch.

Ygritte : You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets-

Jon Snow : Don't call them that.

Ygritte : What, stones? Or bone?

Jon Snow : Neither. Both.

Jon Snow : Move!

Ygritte : I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?

Jon Snow : There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.

Ygritte : So the lads just do it with each other?

Jon Snow : No.

Ygritte : Never?

Jon Snow : Never. We swore an oath.

Ygritte : You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable.

Jon Snow : Would you please shut up?

Ygritte : Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman.

Jon Snow : You're a free woman?

Ygritte : I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman.

Jon Snow : If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what "prisoner" means.

Ygritte : And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.

Jon Snow : It was my choice to say the words.

Ygritte : So you don't like girls?

Jon Snow : Of course I like girls.

Ygritte : But you chose never to touch them.

Jon Snow : That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.

Ygritte : So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands-

Jon Snow : Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!

Ygritte : They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.

Jon Snow : My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours.

Ygritte : So why are you fighting us?

Man : Go on. Now I want you to tell me what happened. Come on, this way. Come on, speak up. Speak up.

Tywin Lannister : Wolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin.

Mountian : We hanged twenty men last night.

Tywin Lannister : I don't care if you hanged a hundred. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.

Mountain : We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.

Tywin Lannister : Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one.

Mountain : Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence.

Tywin Lannister : Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side.

Tywin Lannister : Mmm. Is that mutton?

Arya Stark : Yes, my lord.

Tywin Lannister : Don't like mutton.

Arya Stark : I'll bring something else.

Tywin Lannister : Leave it. Are you hungry?

Arya Stark : No.

Tywin Lannister : Of course you are. Eat.

Arya Stark : I'll eat in the kitchen later.

Tywin Lannister : It's bad manners to refuse a lordo s offer. Sit. Eat.

Tywin Lannister : You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.

Arya Stark : I eat a lot. I just don't grow.

Tywin Lannister : Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.

Arya Stark : Have you ever lost before?

Tywin Lannister : Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?

Tywin Lannister : But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of the Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months.

Tywin Lannister : Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.

Tywin Lannister : The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?

Arya Stark : Dragons?

Tywin Lannister : Yes. Dragons happened.

Tywin Lannister : Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire, Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name

Arya Stark : Aegon and his sisters.

Tywin Lannister : Mmm?

Arya Stark : It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.

Tywin Lannister : Correct. A student of history, are you?

Arya Stark : Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.

Tywin Lannister : I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.

Arya Stark : Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.

Tywin Lannister : Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?

Tywin Lannister : Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?

Arya Stark : Most girls are idiots.

Tywin Lannister : You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?

Arya Stark : From my father.

Tywin Lannister : He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.

Arya Stark : Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?

Tywin Lannister : Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want.

Tywin Lannister : And, girl.

Tywin Lannister : M'lord.

Tywin Lannister : Lowborn girls say "m'lord," not "my lord. " If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly.

Arya Stark : My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord. She taught me how to speak proper Properly.

Tywin Lannister : You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?

Arya Stark : Yes.

Tywin Lannister : Go on.

Sansa Stark : I beg pardon, ser. I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me. You were so brave.

Sandor Clegane : Brave? A dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.

Sansa Stark : Does it give you joy to scare people?

Sandor Clegane : No, it gives me joy to kill people.

Sandor Clegane : Spare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.

Sansa Stark : It was his duty. He never liked it.

Sandor Clegane : Is that what he told you? He lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is.

Sansa Stark : Why are you always so hateful?

Sandor Clegane : You'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king.

Xaro : I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen. One of them did this or knows who did.

Daenerys Targaryen : You are one of the Thirteen.

Xaro : If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them. They mean nothing to me on their own.

Daenerys Targaryen : Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.

Xaro : Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already? We will get them back.

Daenerys Targaryen : There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?

Xaro : I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city. A man is what others say he is and no more. If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing. I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof.

Daenerys Targaryen : But it did happen under your roof.

Xaro : Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been-

Daenerys Targaryen : I don't care where you've been.

Ygritte : You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was.

Jon Snow : No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall.

Ygritte : We chose Mance Rayder to lead us. He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free. You could be free, too. You don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men. Wake up when you want to wake up. I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt. Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night.

Ygritte : You're a pretty lad. The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.

Jon Snow : Walk.

Ygritte : I could teach you how to do it.

Jon Snow : I know how to do it.

Ygritte : You know nothing, Jon Snow.

Robb Stark : And what did she say?

Alton : She admired your spirit, Your Grace.

Robb Stark : And what then?

Alton : She, uh...

Robb Stark : If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang.

Alton : She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.

Robb Stark : You've acted with honor. I thank you for it. Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean, and give him a hot supper.

Rickard Karstark : Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace. The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.

Roose : Too many prisoners.

Robb Stark : Is there room for Ser Alton?

Rickard Karstark : Does he need to lie down?

Robb Stark : Have the men build him a new pen. Put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them.

Rickard Karstark : Torrhen.

Robb Stark : That will be all.

Talisa : Your Grace. A minute of your time?

Talisa : I've been treating your wounded men.

Robb Stark : And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning.

Talisa : They're not my enemies.

Robb Stark : That's what I tell my bannermen.

Talisa : I've already run through the supplies I brought with me. Some are easily replaced. Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.

Robb Stark : But some are not.

Talisa : I need silk for stitching.

Talisa : I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy. You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any. I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over.

Robb Stark : If you need help finding these-

Talisa : I know where to find them. I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.

Robb Stark : Continue, my lady.

Talisa : You're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?

Robb Stark : Yes.

Talisa : The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need.

Robb Stark : I expect he will.

Talisa : If I could write a list-

Robb Stark : Come with me to the Crag.

Talisa : I don't think that will be-

Robb Stark : Let the maester show you his stores. I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men.

Woman : Children, come inside, quick. Come on.

Child : Hurry up!

Man : Can't find anything, ser. They've lost the scent.

Theon Greyjoy : Try again.

Man : We've circled this farmhouse twice. There's no sign of them.

Luwin : We could start the search fresh in the morning, my lord.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people. Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do. I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak.

Man : Prince Theon.

Theon Greyjoy : Where are they?

Winterfell Shepherd : Who, m'lord?

Theon Greyjoy : The Stark boys. Where are they?

Winterfell Shepherd : I don't know. I seen no one.

Theon Greyjoy : Think harder.

Winterfell Shepherd : I swear, m'lord. I don't know.

Dagmer : My lord, over here. I think I've found what we're looking for.

Dagmer : Send the old man home.

Theon Greyjoy : Go back to Winterfell. Take him back.

Luwin : Theon, don't do this.

Daenerys Targaryen : You came back.

Jorah Mormont : As soon as I heard. Do you know anything?

Daenerys Targaryen : Irri is dead.

Jorah Mormont : I know. She was a good-

Daenerys Targaryen : She's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her.

Jorah Mormont : Doreah?

Daenerys Targaryen : We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse.

Jorah Mormont : I should have been here.

Daenerys Targaryen : You went to find me a ship.

Jorah Mormont : My place is by your side. I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.

Daenerys Targaryen : These people"?

Jorah Mormont : They are not to be trusted.

Daenerys Targaryen : And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.

Jorah Mormont : Your people are in Westeros.

Daenerys Targaryen : The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.

Jorah Mormont : They will soon enough.

Daenerys Targaryen : And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.

Jorah Mormont : You are not your brother. Trust me, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : There it is. "Trust me. " And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it.

Jorah Mormont : You are too young to be so-

Daenerys Targaryen : And you are too familiar.

Jorah Mormont : Forgive me, Khaleesi. No one can survive in this world without help. No one. Let me help you, please. Tell me how.

Daenerys Targaryen : Find my dragons.

Ygritte : How long till we get back to your crows?

Jon Snow : We're close.

Ygritte : What, a day? A half-day? You don't know, do you? Do you even know where they are?

Ygritte : What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?

Jon Snow : Nothing happened between you and me.

Ygritte : I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, we were only close together for warmth. And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club. I can show you the bruise on me tailbone. And before I knew what was where, his his Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like. And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did! And he spread me legs and ruined. The shame of it. Now I can never marry a perfumed lord. What will me poor savage father say?

Jon Snow : Turn back around.

Ygritte : And I thought that we were done, but he said, ''Turn back around.'" I'll tell you what, Jon Snow. Since it's gonna be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just-

Jon Snow : What, right here in the muck?

Ygritte : I'll keep you warm enough.

Ygritte : Are you that afraid of it?

Jon Snow : That's enough.

Ygritte : It's nice and wet and warm.

Jon Snow : Enough!

Ygritte : It don't have teeth.

Ygritte : All right! All right. Gods, you're dull.

Ygritte : Should have took me while you had the chance.

Sansa Stark : No, no!

Sansa Stark : No. Oh, no.

Shae : It's all right. Give me that.

Sansa Stark : If the Queen sees, I can have Joffrey's children now.

Shae : Help me flip it over.

Shae : Where are you going?

Handmaiden : To tell Her Grace.

Shae : You'll say nothing to anyone. Do you understand?

Cersei Lannister : Your mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more.

Sansa Stark : My mother told me, but I thought it would be different.

Cersei Lannister : In what way?

Sansa Stark : I thought it would be less messy.

Cersei Lannister : Wait until you birth a child.

Cersei Lannister : You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?

Sansa Stark : I'm fit to bear children for the king?

Cersei Lannister : A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen.

Cersei Lannister : Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.

Sansa Stark : His Grace was not with you?

Cersei Lannister : Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion.

Cersei Lannister : You may never love the king, but you will love his children.

Sansa Stark : I love His Grace with all my heart.

Cersei Lannister : That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice.

Sansa Stark : But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?

Cersei Lannister : You can try, little dove.

Jaime Lannister : Who did you say your mother was again?

Alton : Cinda Lannister.

Jaime Lannister : Is she the fat one?

Alton : Well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she-

Jaime Lannister : No, no. There's only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you'd know it.

Alton : I squired for you once, you know.

Jaime Lannister : When?

Alton : The tournament, the day of Willem Frey's wedding.

Jaime Lannister : I went to Willem Frey's wedding?

Alton : You did. Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up.

Jaime Lannister : He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name?

Alton : Bryan.

Jaime Lannister : Poor lad. That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall. I remember you. You'd never squired for anyone before.

Alton : That's right. I ran up and volunteered. "Let me, my lord. Let me." My father was furious. Afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the Family.

Jaime Lannister : You didn't, though.

Alton : You really remember?

Jaime Lannister : You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them.

Alton : When I think back to that day-

Guard : Shh!

Jaime Lannister : You were saying?

Alton : I- Never mind. It's embarrassing.

Jaime Lannister : More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?

Alton : I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me. I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about.

Jaime Lannister : I understand completely.

Alton : How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you.

Jaime Lannister : It's just that I, I was sixteen once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice.

Alton : Which knight was it?

Jaime Lannister : Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.

Alton : What was he like?

Jaime Lannister : He was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you.

Alton : It's hard to put into words.

Jaime Lannister : It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life.

Alton : Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.

Alton : Did you squire for him again?

Jaime Lannister : No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire.

Jaime Lannister : It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint.

Alton : And have you thought about

Jaime Lannister : Of course. Every day.

Alton : And?

Jaime Lannister : Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful.

Jaime Lannister : But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now.

Alton : What is it?

Jaime Lannister : It's actually quite simple.

Alton : Well, let me help you.

Jaime Lannister : You'll only have to do one thing.

Alton : Tell me.

Jaime Lannister : You'll have to die.

Quaith : Jorah the Andal. This man must sail past old Valyria. All who travel too close to the doom must have protection.

Jorah Mormont : I didn't come here for lessons.

Quaith : No, you came for the dragons.

Jorah Mormont : You have them? Where are they?

Quaith : Draw your sword. See what your steel is worth. You want to please the Mother of Dragons.

Quaith : You love her.

Jorah Mormont : Where are the dragons?

Quaith : Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?

Quaith : Will you betray her again?

Jorah Mormont : Never.

Quaith : The thief you seek is with her now.

Spice King : I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief.

Xaro : No one is calling you a thief. Who is she to accuse us?

Daenerys Targaryen : Please, they're my children. I'm begging you.

Silk King : Begging us? It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.

Daenerys Targaryen : Without me, the dragons will die.

Spice King : It will be for the best. Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear. If I knew where they were, I would not tell you.

Pyat Pree : You are cruel, my friend. The Mother of Dragons is in the right. She must be reunited with her babies. I will help you, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : How?

Pyatt Pree : I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.

Daenerys Targaryen : You have my dragons?

Pyat Pree : When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth. He procured them for me.

Daenerys Targaryen : But there is no King of Qarth.

Xaro : There is now. That was the other half of the arrangement.

Xaro : You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change. I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me.

Spice King : Your ambition is an inspiration. But like all upstarts, you overreach. Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king.

Xaro : An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less. Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise.

Pyat Pree : The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies. She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever.

Pyattpree : A mother should be with her children.

Pyat Pree : Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn? Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying. Come see them.

Jacks : Lady Stark!

Brienne : No farther.

Jacks : Keep your hands off me, woman.

Brienne : Don't enter without an invitation, man.

Jacks : Forgive me. Lady Stark.

Catelyn Stark : What is it?

Jacks : They caught the Kingslayer.

Man : Kingslayer!

Man : Kill the fucking Kingslayer!

Man : Hang him!

Man : You'll die today.

Man : Justice for the Karstark.

Man : Gut him!

Rickard Karstark : Get back! I want his head! Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death.

Catelyn Stark : Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner.

Rickard : This monster killed my son.

Catelyn Stark : And crippled mine. He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here.

Rickard Karstark : I will have his head. And if you try and stop me

Catelyn Stark : You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark. I am the mother of your king!

Rickard Karstark : And where is our king now?

Robb Stark : You know very well.

Rickard Karstark : He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender. Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate. He brought that foreign bitch with him.

Catelyn Stark : How dare you!

Brienne : Threatening my lady is an act of treason.

Rickard Karstark : Treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?

Catelyn Stark : I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it. But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down.

Rickard Karstark : When your son returns, I will demand this murderer's head.

Catelyn Stark : Wise men do not make demands of kings.

Rickard Karstark : Fathers who love their sons do. I will have his head.

Jaime Lannister : Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but-

Catelyn Stark : Take him to the stockades. Bind him with every chain you can find!

Jaime Lannister : You've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you.

Catelyn Stark : And gag him!

Tyrion Lannister : Since when do you light your own candles?

Cersei Lannister : Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.

Cersei Lannister : How many times can you read one raven scroll?

Tyrion Lannister : Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships.

Cersei Lannister : More than we have.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind.

Cersei Lannister : We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above.

Tyrion Lannister : Rain fire on them from above." You're quoting Father, aren't you?

Cersei Lannister : Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?

Tyrion Lannister : Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.

Cersei Lannister : I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.

Tyrion Lannister : He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead

Cersei Lannister : I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.

Tyrion Lannister : I thought the girls might help him.

Cersei Lannister : Did you?

Tyrion Lannister : I was wrong. If we can't control him

Cersei Lannister : Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.

Tyrion Lannister : It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.

Cersei Lannister : I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.

Tyrion Lannister : The boy is more Robert than Jaime.

Cersei Lannister : Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins.

Tyrion Lannister : Sins?

Cersei Lannister : The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? "Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."

Tyrion Lannister : You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them.

Man : Then why wait?

Man : We're sworn to the king.

Man : There's not a king.

Man : That's treason.

Man : So is saving Lannisters, yeah?

Man : Back off, you.

Man : No, I won't.

Brienne : Your son returns at dawn, my lady?

Catelyn Stark : So they say.

Brienne : The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?

Catelyn Stark : Come.

Catelyn Stark : I need to be alone with him.

Guard : My lady, our orders-

Catelyn Stark : Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him.

Jaime Lannister : Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?

Catelyn Stark : Do you hear them out there? They want your head.

Jaime Lannister : Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.

Catelyn Stark : You strangled his son with your chains.

Jaime Lannister : Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.

Catelyn Stark : You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.

Jaime Lannister : So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?

Catelyn Stark : She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer.

Jaime Lannister : Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back.

Catelyn Stark : You are a man without honor.

Jaime Lannister : Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered?

Catelyn Stark : Brienne.

Jaime Lannister : No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman.

Catelyn Stark : Your sword.

Theon Greyjoy : I told you what would happen. All of you. I told you what would happen if you served me loyally. And what would happen if you did not.

Luwin : What are you doing? What have you done?

Theon Greyjoy : If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question.

Luwin : No!

Man : Riders approaching!

Mar : Open the gate!

Yara Greyjoy : Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.

Theon Greyjoy : Envy isn't attractive.

Yara Greyjoy : What envy?

Theon Greyjoy : You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with twenty men.

Yara Greyjoy : You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?

Theon Greyjoy : I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery.

Yara Greyjoy : You treated them with honor? By butchering them?

Theon Greyjoy : Before I had to kill them- I treated them-

Yara Greyjoy : You seized their home, as is your right. We're Ironborn, we take what we need.

Theon Greyjoy : Exactly.

Yara Greyjoy : Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away. Is that treachery? I'd call it bravery.

Theon Greyjoy : They made me a promise

Yara Greyjoy : Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it? Are you the dumbest cunt alive?

Theon Greyjoy : Don't call me

Yara Greyjoy : A cunt. A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell. You know how valuable those boys were?

Theon Greyjoy : If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak.

Yara Greyjoy : You are weak. And you're stupid.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm warning you.

Yara Greyjoy : Go on, then. Warn me.

Theon Greyjoy : You haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?

Yara Greyjoy : You're not. I've come to bring you home. Father wants a word.

Theon Greyjoy : Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.

Yara Greyjoy : Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. When Robb Stark finds out-

Theon Greyjoy : He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell.

Yara Greyjoy : Leave us.

Yara Greyjoy : Theon, you're my blood. We both loved our mother. We both endured our father. Come home with me. Don't die here alone.

Theon Greyjoy : I don't intend to die.

Yara Greyjoy : You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping. And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea.

Ygritte : I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones.

Lord Of Bones : I already got one crow. Don't need two.

Ygritte : Mance will want to question this one. Knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.

Lord Of Bones : The Halfhand knows more. This one is just a little boy. Gut him.

Ygritte : He could have killed me half a dozen times.

Lord Of Bones : And now he wishes he did. Gut him.

Ygritte : He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son.

Ygritte : Mance will want him.

Lord Of Bones : What does Mance want with a dead man's bastard?

Ygritte : I don't know. I think he'll want to decide for himself.

Lord Of Bones : He runs, I'll chop his balls off.

Ygritte : He runs, I'll do it meself.

Ygritte : We're even now, Jon Snow.

Jon Snow : I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't-

Qhorin : I know.

Jon Snow : The others?

Qhorin : When you didn't come back, we went looking for you. We found your tracks fast enough. But they found us before we found you.

Jon Snow : They died because of me.

Qhorin : See that it wasn't for nothing.

Wildling : All right, up, lad.

Wildling : Come on, on your feet, now. Move it.

Talisa : Is she beautiful?

Robb Stark : I've never met her.

Talisa : What's her name?

Robb Stark : Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name.

Talisa : I'm sure you'll be very happy.

Talisa : And you're marrying her for a bridge?

Robb Stark : An important bridge.

Talisa : Ah.

Robb Stark : It was before they killed my father. I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge.

Talisa : When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father.

Robb Stark : He was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but

Talisa : Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me.

Robb Stark : He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, "How can a man be brave if he's afraid?" "That is the only time a man can be brave," he told me.

Talisa : I wish I could have met him.

Robb Stark : He would have liked you.

Talisa : Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.

Robb Stark : He didn't care much about gold or glory.

Talisa : And you? You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me? I want to go home. I want the men following me to go home.

Talisa : Then why don't you?

Robb Stark : Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.

Talisa : Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean.

Robb Stark : That would be a start.

Rider : Your Grace, milady. The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.

Robb Stark : How? How?

Robb Stark : Tell me this isn't true.

Robb Stark : Why?

Catelyn Stark : For the girls.

Robb Stark : You betrayed me.

Catelyn Stark : Robb-

Robb Stark : No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.

Catelyn Stark : Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell. Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing. I have five children, and only one of them is free.

Rickard Karstark : I lost one son fighting by your son's side. I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain. You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell.

Catelyn Stark : I grieve for your sons, my lord.

Rickard Karstark : I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance. And you stole it from me.

Catelyn Stark : Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine.

Robb Stark : Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night.

Catelyn Stark : Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?

Soldier : Forty, Your Grace.

Robb Stark : Send another forty with our fastest horses.

Catelyn Stark : Robb.

Jaime Lannister : Damn.

Jaime Lannister : You're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin.

Jaime Lannister : A captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity.

Brienne : Brienne of Tarth.

Jaime Lannister : Tarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another.

Jaime Lannister : Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.

Jaime Lannister : I didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me.

Brienne : Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer.

Jaime Lannister : Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?

Brienne : You've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent.

Jaime Lannister : Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?

Brienne : You will not provoke me to anger.

Jaime Lannister : I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?

Brienne : I've never seen you fight.

Jaime Lannister : The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.

Brienne : All my life men like you have sneered at me. And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.

Jaime Lannister : If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens.

Brienne : Do you take me for an idiot? In!

Jaime Lannister : I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid.

Brienne : Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer.

Kevan : King's Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force. It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety.

Tywin Lannister : Surrender the Iron Throne?

Kevan : Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates. Stannis will execute them all.

Tywin Lannister : No, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep.

Kevan : The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.

Tywin Lannister : Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner.

Tywin Lannister : Too close to Casterly Rock.

Kevan : He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell. The Greyjoys have done us a great favor. Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.

Tywin Lannister : He's a boy and he's never lost a battle. He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.

Tywin Lannister : We'll ride at nightfall. I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move. Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl has proven herself a good servant. She'll stay on with you. See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings. He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work.

Guard : You've got some questions to answer.

Man : Who killed Ser Amory?

Man : I don't know! Please!

Man : Give me the name. Take this one out for the crows.

Man : I told you, I don't know. Please.

Rorge : Look, it's Yoren's little cunt. Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.

Arya Stark : Where's Jaqen?

Rorge : Don't care. Where's your stick now, bitch? I promised to fuck you with it.

Guard : Come on, time to kill some wolves.

Hot Pie : You need sour cherries to make it right. And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet. That's where the real flavor is. You crush 'em up real fine. And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust.

Hot Pie : How would I know?

Arya Stark : I need him now. Lord Tywin's marching tonight.

Gendry Baratheon : You need him?

Arya Stark : He's helping me.

Hot Pie : I saw him.

Arya Stark : Where?

Hot Pie : Ow!

Hot Pie : They went riding out the gates a few hours ago.

Hot Pie : On patrol. Let go of my ears.

Hot Pie : What do you want with him anyway?

Quorin : Mance is gonna march on the Wall. When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth a thousand fighting against it.

Jon Snow : They'll never trust me.

Quorin : They might. If you do what needs to be done.

Jon Snow : What?

Quorin : How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?

Jon Snow : I didn't.

Quorin : I should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard.

Lord Of Bones : He's not yours to kill, crow.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you have to do that here?

Bronn : I like to keep me hands clean.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, but do you have to do it here?

Tyrion Lannister : You should start wearing the gold cloak.

Bronn : I don't want to wear a gold cloak.

Tyrion Lannister : You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common

Bronn : A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out.

Bronn : We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.

Tyrion Lannister : Fine, fine. No gold cloak.

Tyrion Lannister : What?

Bronn : What?

Tyrion Lannister : What? What? Why are you staring at me?

Bronn : You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?

Tyrion Lannister : To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.

Tyrion Lannister : Stannis will be here any day.

Bronn : And one of these explains how to beat him?

Tyrion Lannister : An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. " By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh.

Bronn : Chevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.

Varys : My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?

Tyrion Lannister : I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?

Bronn : Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.

Tyrion Lannister : For questioning?

Bronn : No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.

Tyrion Lannister : We talked about this.

Bronn : Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Foodo s worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other.

Bronn : The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town.

Varys : Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted.

Varys : Ah. "The Great Sieges of Westeros." Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer.

Tyrion Lannister : Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land.

Varys : And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?

Bronn : We could throw books at his men.

Varys : We don't have that many books.

Bronn : We don't have that many men, either.

Varys : What do we have?

Tyrion Lannister : Pig shit.

Sam : I'm not cut out for this sort of work.

Dolorous Edd : I always imagined meself doing something much worse.

Grenn : We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world. I can't imagine anything much worse.

Dolorous Edd : You lack imagination.

Sam : Where do you think Jon is right now?

Dolorous Edd : He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back. A betting man would go with dead.

Sam : He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter.

Grenn : Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you.

Sam : He's got a Valyrian steel sword.

Eddision : So did his father.

Sam : And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.

Dolorous Edd : Great rangers never get old is the problem. Shit ones neither. It's them in the middle that last a long time.

Grenn : What in seven hells is that?

Sam : The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.

Grenn : Look.

Dolorous Edd : If you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it.

Sam : That's a Night's Watch cloak.

Grenn : It's been here a long time.

Sam : Oh. Must be dragonglass.

Grenn : Dragonglass?

Sam : The maesters call it obsidian.

Grenn : Why would a brother hide it here?

Dolorous Edd : I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.

Soldier : Mind where you're going.

Arya Stark : I'm sorry. I'll-

Arya Stark : Where were you?

Jaqen Hghar : A man has patrol duty.

Arya Stark : Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone.

Jaqen Hghar : A girl owes one more name. The Red God demands it. Give the man a name.

Arya Stark : How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?

Jaqen Hghar : A minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not.

Arya Stark : He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now.

Jaqen Hghar : This a man cannot do.

Arya Stark : You promised you'd help me.

Jaqen Hghar : Help was not promised, lovely girl. Only death. There must be others. Give a name, any name.

Arya Stark : And you'll kill them? Anybody?

Jaqen Hghar : By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it.

Arya Stark : All right. Jaqen H'ghar.

Jaqen Hghar : A girl gives a man his own name?

Arya Stark : That's right.

Jaqen Hghar : Gods are not mocked. This is no joking thing.

Arya Stark : I'm not joking. A man can go kill himself.

Jaqen Hghar : Un-name me.

Arya Stark : No.

Jaqen Hghar : Please?

Arya Stark : I'll un-name you.

Jaqen Hghar : Thank you.

Arya Stark : If you help me and my friends escape.

Jaqen Hghar : This would require more than one life. This is not part of our bargain.

Arya Stark : Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.

Jaqen Hghar : A girl lacks honor. If I do this thing, a girl must obey.

Arya Stark : A girl will obey.

Jaqen Hghar : A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.

Tyrion Lannister : Thank you, Podrick.

Cersei Lannister : Odd little boy.

Tyrion Lannister : I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.

Cersei Lannister : You and Varys both.

Tyrion Lannister : Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.

Cersei Lannister : He's only a boy.

Tyrion Lannister : Younger boys are off fighting his war.

Cersei Lannister : He's not ready.

Tyrion Lannister : What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?

Cersei Lannister : Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us.

Cersei Lannister : Do you think I'm an idiot?

Tyrion Lannister : No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence.

Cersei Lannister : You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.

Tyrion Lannister : He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?

Cersei Lannister : Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?

Tyrion Lannister : Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.

Cersei Lannister : Because he doesn't have a cock.

Tyrion Lannister : Neither do you.

Cersei Lannister : Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not that little.

Tyrion Lannister : Why are you smiling?

Cersei Lannister : Because I'm happy.

Tyrion Lannister : And why are you happy?

Cersei Lannister : Because I have your little whore.

Tyrion Lannister : I thought you preferred blondes.

Cersei Lannister : Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased.

Tyrion Lannister : Why do you care who I fuck?

Cersei Lannister : Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed.

Tyrion Lannister : This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.

Cersei Lannister : For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time.

Tyrion Lannister : Where did you find her?

Cersei Lannister : Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully.

Tyrion Lannister : You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.

Cersei Lannister : Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me.

Tyrion Lannister : You don't buy them, you only rent them.

Cersei Lannister : You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt.

Tyrion Lannister : And how do I know you haven't killed her already?

Cersei Lannister : Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.

Tyrion Lannister : I promise I will free you.

Ros : Don't forget me.

Tyrion Lannister : Never.

Tyrion Lannister : I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid.

Cersei Lannister : Get out.

Tyrion Lannister : Shae!

Shae : I've been waiting all night. What is wrong?

Tyrion Lannister : You're beautiful.

Shae : Then why do you look sad?

Tyrion Lannister : We have to be more careful.

Shae : Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.

Tyrion Lannister : There are people who want to hurt me.

Shae : I know. I won't let them. I'll cut off their faces. I will.

Tyrion Lannister : I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.

Shae : I'm yours.

Tyrion Lannister : Promise me.

Shae : I'm yours and you are mine.

Robb Stark : Still no word?

Roose Bolton : We've sent a dozen ravens. None have returned. My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell. Once he captures the castle

Robb Stark : Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle

Roose Bolton : He wouldn't dare hurt the boys. They're his only hope of escaping the North with his head.

Robb Stark : Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.

Roose Bolton : A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much-

Robb Stark : Any Ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.

Roose Bolton : I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.

Talisa : Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace.

Roose Bolton : My lady.

Talisa : How are you?

Robb Stark : How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.

Talisa : I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.

Robb Stark : No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.

Talisa : You have every right. You're a king.

Robb Stark : That's not the kind of king I want to be.

Talisa : What kind do you want to be?

Robb Stark : I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.

Talisa : I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry.

Robb Stark : I'd like to hear you play the harp.

Talisa : No. No, you would not.

Robb Stark : How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?

Talisa : When I was twelve, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on.

Robb Stark : I don't want to marry the Frey girl.

Talisa : I don't want you to marry her. But you needed that bridge. I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.

Hot Pie : The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready.

Gendry Baratheon : Shut up.

Hot Pie : Probably in the piecrust by now. In the oven. The nice, warm oven.

Arya Stark : Shut up. What did you bring?

Yara Greyjoy : Shut up. What did you bring?

Hot Pie : The cheese could be better. I did get some nice sausages.

Gendry Baratheon : What did he want us to do about those guards?

Arya Stark : He didn't say. He just said, "Walk through the gates."

Gendry Baratheon : What about the guards?

Arya Stark : He didn't say anything about the guards.

Gendry Baratheon : What, he left that bit out? It's a pretty important part, don't you think?

Arya Stark : We have to trust him.

Gendry Baratheon : Trust him? You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.

Hot Pie : I want to go back to the kitchens.

Arya Stark : Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.

Gendry Baratheon : Arry, don't.

Man : Away! Reset!

Davos : If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day.

Stannis Baratheon : Will it hold?

Davos : Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.

Man : Again, pull!

Stannis Baratheon : I admire you, Ser Davos.

Davos : I thank you, Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.

Davos : My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me.

Stannis Baratheon : Do you? Why?

Davos : My father was a crabber.

Stannis Baratheon : And?

Davos : Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink.

Stannis Baratheon : And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?

Davos : Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.

Stannis Baratheon : You defend these men who insult you behind your back.

Davos : Some are happy to do it to my face.

Stannis Baratheon : We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with five hundred men.

Davos : No one has forgotten, Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.

Davos : He was only a boy.

Stannis Baratheon : Then why'd he give him Storm's End?

Stannis Baratheon : First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions.

Davos : And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.

Stannis Baratheon : Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.

Davos : I was relieved they did not.

Stannis Baratheon : Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand.

Davos : Your Grace, I pray I serve you well.

Stannis Baratheon : I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.

Joffrey Lannister : You're the Master of Whisperers. You're supposed to know everything.

Varys : No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.

Joffrey Lannister : The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.

Tyrion Lannister : To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

Joffrey Lannister : If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him.

Tyrion Lannister : A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you.

Joffrey Lannister : They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.

Tyrion Lannister : Imagine Stannis' terror.

Varys : I am trying.

Tyrion Lannister : You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.

Varys : Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you.

Tyrion Lannister : I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men.

Varys : I wish we could, too.

Tyrion Lannister : What do you want? Tell me.

Varys : If we're going to play, you'll have to start.

Tyrion Lannister : My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

Varys : A most highborn plumber.

Tyrion Lannister : The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand

Varys : You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game.

Tyrion Lannister : I do. Last thing I expected.

Varys : And you play it well.

Tyrion Lannister : I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over.

Varys : They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.

Tyrion Lannister : The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?

Varys : In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats.

Tyrion Lannister : We should sail there immediately.

Varys : This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives.

Tyrion Lannister : A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.

Varys : She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide.

Tyrion Lannister : One game at a time, my friend.

Jorah Mormont : Careful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you. I found one. A ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.

Daenerys Targaryen : Astapor?

Jorah Mormont : We cannot stay here.

Daenerys Targaryen : They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.

Jorah Mormont : They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.

Daenerys Targaryen : You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.

Jorah Mormont : You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.

Daenerys Targaryen : Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there.

Jorah Mormont : That's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong.

Daenerys Targaryen : And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?

Jorah Mormont : Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face.

Daenerys Targaryen : They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.

Theon Greyjoy : We should bury them.

Dagmer : I'd leave 'em up a few more days. Sends a message.

Theon Greyjoy : If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.

Dagmer : What's this?

Theon Greyjoy : Gold for the farmer. For his trouble.

Dagmer : His troubles are done. He's feeding the crops now.

Dagmer : His wife, too. You want to keep a man silent, you silence him.

Osha : Got as far as the farm and then doubled back. Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds. Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.

Luwin : You're right so far.

Osha : Who was that out there hung up at the gates?

Luwin : Must have been the farmer's boys.

Osha : He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?

Luwin : They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself.

Osha : They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.

Matthos : That's it. The tide's against us.

Davos : Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates.

Matthos : You're coming home.

Davos : King's Landing hasn't been home for twenty years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.

Matthos : This is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain.

Davos : Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment.

Matthos : Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand.

Davos : Gods be good.

Matthos : God. Father, there is only one and he watches over us.

Davos : But not over them?

Matthos : Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike.

Davos : Well, first, we have to put it there.

Matthos : Our ships outnumber theirs ten-to-one.

Davos : Our army outnumber theirs five-to-one. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire.

Matthos : I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain.

Shae : Are you afraid, my lion?

Tyrion Lannister : If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid.

Shae : I won't let them hurt you.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.

Shae : It is now.

Tyrion Lannister : You can't fuck your way out of everything.

Shae : I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.

Pycelle : As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war.

Cersei Lannister : Your words are always wise and measured.

Pycelle : If you could - If anything, a maester's duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil. I remember back in the days of King

Cersei Lannister : You brought me something?

Pycelle : Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however-

Cersei Lannister : I know what ten drops will bring.

Pycelle : Your Grace, if I may ask-

Cersei Lannister : You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.

Pycelle : Yes. A siege is very-

Cersei Lannister : Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many.

Pycelle : Your Grace.

Men : And so he spoke / That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his halls / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his halls / And not a soul to hear-

Bronn : To the boys!

Soldier : Lannisters! Where'd you learn the Lannister song?

Bronn : Drunk Lannisters.

Prostitute : You've got a pretty voice.

Bronn : Thank you very much.

Prostitute : And I like your nose. How many times you break it?

Bronn : Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker.

Prostitute : Oh.

Bronn : It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.

Bronn : Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time-

Bronn : Eh, you don't want to know about the third time.

Prostitute : Poor nose.

Bronn : Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.

Bronn : Welcome, friends. This roundo s on me.

Bronn : I don't think he likes me.

Sandor Clegane : You think you're a hard man?

Bronn : I know it.

Bronn : It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.

Sandor Clegane : Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me.

Sandor Clegane : Only smaller.

Bronn : And quicker. Eh?

Sandor Clegane : Your Lord Imp's going to miss you.

Bronn : Aye I expect he will someday.

Man : Here we are.

Bronn : One more drink before the war? Shall we?

Varys : I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege.

Tyrion Lannister : A wedding.

Varys : Exactly. Podrick, is that it?

Tyrion Lannister : Is that it?" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town.

Varys : I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.

Varys : Do you trust him?

Tyrion Lannister : Oddly enough, I do.

Varys : Good.

Varys : The map you asked for.

Tyrion Lannister : There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.

Varys : Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her.

Varys : That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, I'm not.

Varys : For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai.

Tyrion Lannister : What of it?

Varys : You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?

Tyrion Lannister : Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?

Varys : I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.

Tyrion Lannister : Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself.

Varys : And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut.

Tyrion Lannister : No, I don't believe you have.

Varys : One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him.

Matthos : They're welcoming the new king.

Davos : I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.

Matthos : Drums!

Tyrion Lannister : Remember, wait till the ships-

Bronn : The ships are in the bay.

Tyrion Lannister : They must be far enough in-

Bronn : I know what "in" means. Do you know how to use that?

Tyrion Lannister : I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood.

Bronn : I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.

Bronn : Don't get killed.

Tyrion Lannister : Nor you, my friend.

Bronn : Oh, are we friends now?

Tyrion Lannister : Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.

Bronn : Enhances it, really.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh! "Enhances." Fancy word for a sellsword.

Bronn : Been spending time with fancy folks.

Tyrion Lannister : Lady Sansa and Sheila.

Shae : Shae.

Tyrion Lannister : Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.

Sansa Stark : She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.

Joffrey Lannister : Sansa.

Tyrion Lannister : Always been a great romantic, my nephew.

Joffrey Lannister : Sansa, come here.

Sansa Stark : I will pray for your safe return, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Will you?

Sansa Stark : Just as I pray for the king's.

Tyrion Lannister : Stay safe, my lady.

Shae : And you, my lion.

Joffrey Lannister : Your king rides forth to battle. You should see him off with a kiss.

Joffrey Lannister : My new blade. Hearteater, I've named it. Kiss it.

Joffrey Lannister : You'll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle's blood.

Sansa Stark : Will you slay him yourself?

Joffrey Lannister : If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.

Sansa Stark : So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?

Joffrey Lannister : A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.

Sansa Stark : I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender.

Joffrey Lannister : Your brother's turn will come. Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too.

Shae : Some of those boys will never come back.

Sansa Stark : Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.

Shae : Shh. Come, my lady.

Lancel : Where's our fleet?

Tyrion Lannister : On the way.

Joffrey Lannister : Why isn't it here now? They're coming.

Joffrey Lannister : Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question.

Sandor Clegane : The king has asked you a question.

Tyrion Lannister : Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy.

Lancel : The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king-

Joffrey Lannister : If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought.

Tyrion Lannister : That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet.

Davos : Where are their ships?

Matthos : It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.

Davos : Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.

Matthos : If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied.

Davos : Maybe.

Sansa Stark : I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.

Shae : Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.

Sansa Stark : I doubt it.

Shae : Maybe she's jealous of you.

Sansa Stark : Why would she be jealous?

Cersei Lannister : Sansa.

Cersei Lannister : I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?

Sansa Stark : Yes.

Cersei Lannister : Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine.

Shae : I'm not thirsty, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : So? I didn't offer you water.

Sansa Stark : What's he doing here?

Cersei Lannister : Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him.

Sansa Stark : But we have guards to defend us.

Cersei Lannister : Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors.

Gold Cloak : The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.

Cersei Lannister : The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.

Cersei Lannister : The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.

Sansa Stark : You said he was here to protect us.

Cersei Lannister : He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.

Joffrey Lannister : There they are.

Tyrion Lannister : Archers to their marks.

Soldier : Archers, to your marks!

Soldier : Archers! Nock your arrows!

Soldier : Nock arrows!

Tyrion Lannister : Hold fast.

Soldier : Hold fast!

Joffrey Lannister : What are you doing? We need to attack them.

Soldier : Boulders ready!

Joffrey Lannister : There's only one ship. Where are the rest of them? Where are the rest of them?

Matthos : There's only one ship.

Davos : Archers, stand to! Man the below! Nock.

Man : Nock and set!

Davos : Draw! Hold.

Man : Hold.

Davos : There's no one on board.

Man : More rocks coming up!

Davos : Wildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear!

Davos : Matthos! Get down!

Stannis Baratheon : Prepare to land.

Soldier : Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : The dwarf has played his little trick.

Soldier : The wildfire.

Stannis Baratheon : He can only play it once.

Soldier : We're too far from the gates. The fire, their archers- Hundreds will die.

Stannis Baratheon : Thousands.

Stannis Baratheon : Come with me and take this city!

Cersei Lannister : Sansa, come here, little dove.

Sansa Stark : My queen.

Cersei Lannister : What are you doing?

Sansa Stark : Praying.

Cersei Lannister : You're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for?

Sansa Stark : For the gods to have mercy on us all.

Cersei Lannister : Oh. On all of us?

Sansa Stark : Yes, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : Even me?

Sansa Stark : Of course, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : Even Joffrey?

Sansa Stark : Joffrey is my-

Cersei Lannister : Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four.

Sansa Stark : Your father doesn't believe in the gods?

Cersei Lannister : He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much.

Cersei Lannister : One for her.

Cersei Lannister : Here. Sit. Drink.

Cersei Lannister : Not like that. Drink, girl.

Cersei Lannister : I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.

Sansa Stark : They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here.

Cersei Lannister : It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits.

Sansa Stark : And if the city should fall?

Cersei Lannister : You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse.

Cersei Lannister : Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink.

Cersei Lannister : Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten.

Man : More pressure! Pull! Pull! That's it, men! Pull! Pull!

Tyrion Lannister : He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon.

Joffrey Lannister : They're coming. They're coming ashore.

Tyrion Lannister : Rain fire on them.

Man : Archers!

Joffrey Lannister : There are too many.

Tyrion Lannister : Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now.

Podrick : Yes, my lord.

Sandor Clegane : Let's go. Stannis is sending us fresh meat. You, too.

Sandor Clegane : Any of these flaming fucking arrows come near me, I'll strangle you with your own guts.

Men : Pull, pull! Go!

Soldier : Nock! Draw!

Men : Draw! Draw!

Men : Kill the Lannisters!

Men : Loose! Loose!

Man : Form the line!

Men : Draw! Draw! Loose! Loose!

Stannis Baratheon : To the Mud Gate, go now!

Men : First and second squads, to the gate! To the Mud Gate!

Sandor Clegane : Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fucking corpse.

Cersei Lannister : When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired.

Sansa Stark : You were Robert's queen.

Cersei Lannister : And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one.

Cersei Lannister : Pretty.

Cersei Lannister : That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend.

Cersei Lannister : Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?

Shae : A few weeks, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : When did you leave Lorath?

Cersei Lannister : I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.

Cersei Lannister : But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?

Shae : Ten years ago, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?

Shae : Shae, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : Tell us a story, Shae.

Shae : When I was thireen, I-

Lancel : Your Grace!

Cersei Lannister : What news?

Lancel : The Imp has set the river afire. Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more. Stannis' fleet destroyed, but But But his troops have landed outside the city walls.

Cersei Lannister : Where is Joffrey?

Lancel : On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.

Cersei Lannister : Bring him back inside at once.

Lancel : Your Grace-

Cersei Lannister : What?

Lancel : The king's presence is good for morale.

Cersei Lannister : Bring him back to his chambers now.

Lancel : Not here?

Cersei Lannister : With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?

Lancel : No, but I-

Cersei Lannister : Now!

Cersei Lannister : When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive.

Man : Help me!

Man : Fall back! Fall back!

Stannis Baratheon : Get the ladders up!

Man : Faster, you bastards! Faster! Come on, kill the scum!

Sandor Clegane : Someone bring me a drink.

Sandor Clegane : Fuck the water. Bring me wine.

Tyrion Lannister : Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?

Sandor Clegane : Eat shit, dwarf.

Tyrion Lannister : You're on the wrong side of the wall.

Sandor Clegane : I lost half my men. The Blackwater's on fire.

Joffrey Lannister : Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight!

Tyrion Lannister : You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city.

Sandor Clegane : Fuck the Kingsguard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king.

Man : Loose!

Man : Put your backs into it!

Man : All right, get up!

Man : Clear!

Man : Forward!

Man : Forward ladders!

Men : Heave! Heave!

Lancel : Your Grace, the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep.

Tyrion Lannister : If you won't defend your own city, why should they?

Joffrey Lannister : What would you have me do?

Tyrion Lannister : Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.

Joffrey Lannister : What did my mother say exactly? Did she have urgent business with me?

Lancel : She did not say, Your Grace.

Man : All men to the battlements!

Joffrey Lannister : Ser Boros, Ser Mandon, stay with my uncle and represent the king on the field of battle.

Man : Archers, hold your line or I'll kill you myself.

Man : Stand fast!

Man : No! Get up, you fool.

Man : We need more arrows!

Man : Where is the king? Why isn't he with us?

Man : Who are we fighting for?

Man : Who leads us?

Tyrion Lannister : I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!

Man : Yes.

Man : What are you talking about?

Tyrion Lannister : Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?

Man : The only way out is through the gates. And they're at the gates.

Tyrion Lannister : There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.

Tyrion Lannister : Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape.

Men : Heave! Heave! Heave!

Tyrion Lannister : Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.

Lancel : The battle is lost, Your Grace. Stannis' troops are at the gates. When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart.

Cersei Lannister : Where is my son?

Lancel : I want to escort him back to the battle.

Cersei Lannister : Why do I care what you want? Bring me-

Lancel : Now listen to me-

Sansa Stark : Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Gentle mother, fount of mercy...

All : Save our sons from war, we pray.

Shae : You must go. Run to your chamber and bar your door. Stannis won't hurt you. This one will.

Sansa Stark : Come with me.

Shae : I need to say goodbye to someone.

Sansa Stark : The queen said they'd rape everyone.

Shae : No one is raping me.

Shae : Go. Run.

Sandor Clegane : The lady is starting to panic.

Sansa Stark : What are you doing here?

Sandor Clegane : Not here for long. I'm going.

Sansa Stark : Where?

Sandor Clegane : Someplace that isn't burning. North, might be. Could be.

Sansa Stark : What about the king?

Sandor Clegane : He can die just fine on his own.

Sandor Clegane : I can take you with me. Take you to Winterfell.

Sandor Clegane : I'll keep you safe. Do you want to go home?

Sansa Stark : I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.

Sandor Clegane : Look at me. Stannis is a killer. The Lannisters are killers. Your father was a killer. Your brother is a killer. Your sons will be killers someday. The world is built by killers. So you'd better get used to looking at them.

Sansa Stark : You won't hurt me.

Sandor Clegane : No, little bird, I won't hurt you.

Men : Heave!

Man : Come on, you bastards! Get up those ladders!

Tyrion Lannister : Attack!

Men : Roll it over!

All : Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, fuck me.

Cersei Lannister : Shh! Be calm, my sweet.

Tommen Lannister : They're still fighting.

Cersei Lannister : No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.

Tommen Lannister : The Kingswood?

Cersei Lannister : Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things.

Tommen Lannister : Like what?

Cersei Lannister : Like stags.

Tommen Lannister : Stags aren't evil. They only eat grass.

Cersei Lannister : And wolves.

Podrick : My lord.

Cersei Lannister : He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, "You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid."

Cersei Lannister : For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. You will be king. All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, they will all come to you, little lion, to rest a crown upon your head.

Cersei Lannister : And the cub said, "Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"

Cersei Lannister : Yes," said his mother. "You will be strong and fierce just like your father.

Cersei Lannister : I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you.

Man : Back to the boats!

Stannis Baratheon : Stand and fight! Stand and fight, damn you!

Stannis Baratheon : No!

Cersei Lannister : Father.

Tywin Lannister : The battle is over. We have won.

Male Singer : And who are you," the proud lord said / "That I must bow so low?" / "Only a cat of a different coat / That's all the truth I know / In a coat of gold or a coat of red / A lion still has claws / And mine are long and sharp, my lord / As long and sharp as yours" / And so he spoke, and so he spoke / That Lord of Castamere / But now the rains weep o'er his hall / With no one there to hear / Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall / And not a soul to hear

Tyrion Lannister : Pod.

Tyrion Lannister : Pod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive.

Podrick : Yes, my lord.

Pycelle : Would you like something for the pain?

Tyrion Lannister : What happened?

Pycelle : The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father.

Tyrion Lannister : Where am I?

Pycelle : These are your new chambers. A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand of the King.

Pycelle : Oh, For your trouble.

Joffrey Lannister : I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, do hereby proclaim my grandfather, Tywin Lannister, the savior of the city and the Hand of the King.

Tywin Lannister : Thank you, Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward.

Joffrey Lannister : For your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell, I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time.

Petyr Baelish : You honor me beyond words, Your Grace. I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons.

Joffrey Lannister : Ser Loras Tyrell.

Joffrey Lannister : Your house has come to our aid. The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I. If your family would ask anything of me, ask it, and it shall be yours.

Loras : Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before... She remains innocent. I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor of joining our houses.

Joffrey Lannister : Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?

Margaery Tyrell : With all my heart, Your Grace. I have come to love you from afar. Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears. And those tales have taken root deep inside of me.

Joffrey Lannister : I, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, my lady. It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another. A king must keep his word.

Cersei Lannister : Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside.

Crowd : Margaery! We want Margaery!

Joffrey Lannister : I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow.

Pycelle : Your Grace, the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness. I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods.

Joffrey Lannister : The gods are good. I am free to heed my heart. Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister. You will be my queen and I will love you from this day until my last day.

Petyr Baelish : My lady. My sincerest condolences.

Sansa Stark : They're right. I'm not good enough for him.

Petyr Baelish : You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well.

Sansa Stark : But, if he's not marrying me-

Petyr Baelish : He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home.

Sansa Stark : King's Landing is my home now.

Petyr Baelish : Look around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you.

Ros : Come in. Make yourself comfortable.

Ros : That doesn't look very comfortable. Here, watch me.

Varys : No need for that, my dear.

Ros : You sure? Most men like what they see.

Varys : I'm not like most men.

Ros : That's what most men say.

Ros : If you don't want what most men want, then you'd better tell me what you'd like me to do.

Varys : I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.

Ros : Have we met?

Varys : You wouldn't remember me if we had?

Ros : I meet a lot of men.

Varys : And I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them.

Ros : You're very kind, my lord. Allow me to return the favor.

Varys : You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there.

Ros : I know who you are.

Varys : And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other.

Ros : How do you know about that?

Varys : I thought you said you knew who I was.

Ros : What can I do for you, Lord Varys?

Varys : Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.

Ros : I'm afraid of him.

Varys : Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks.

Jaime Lannister : You're a virgin, I take it?

Brienne : Walk.

Jaime Lannister : Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne.

Brienne : One or two tried.

Jaime Lannister : Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough.

Brienne : Not interested.

Jaime Lannister : Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.

Jaime Lannister : Ah. "They lay with lions." Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks.

Brienne : I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.

Jaime Lannister : Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.

Jaime Lannister : What are you doing?

Brienne : Burying them.

Jaime Lannister : We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.

Brienne : I think these women would understand if I don't care what you think.

Man : I didn't leave it here.

Man : I had me dagger.

Jaime Lannister : Untie me. Now!

Man : I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don't have me dagger no more.

Man : So unless it got stuck in your arse on its way to your cunt, it stands to reason that it's gone. Whoa. What's your business here?

Brienne : Traveling a prisoner.

Man : You're a woman. A woman!

Man : Well, fuck me!

Brienne : If you've quite finished up-

Brienne : All right, we'll be going.

Man : Whoa. Whoa! Who do you fight for?

Brienne : The Starks.

Man : What did he do?

Jaime Lannister : Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?

Brienne : No, stealing is a crime.

Jaime Lannister : But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.

Man : Where are you taking him?

Brienne : To Riverrun.

Man : Why Riverrun?

Brienne : Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in.

Man : Why not kill him?

Jaime Lannister : For stealing a pig?

Brienne : I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.

Man : Sending him with you? How important could he be?

Man : All right, have it your way, my lady.

Man : Do I know you?

Jaime Lannister : Have you been to Ashemark?

Man : No.

Jaime Lannister : Then you don't know me.

Man : Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?

Jaime Lannister : Is it near Ashemark?

Jaime Lannister : I've never been there.

Man : What do you think of these beauties?

Brienne : I hope you gave them quick deaths.

Man : Two of them we did, yeah.

Man : Wait. I do know you. That's Jaime Lannister.

Jaime Lannister : I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.

Brienne : If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it.

Man : How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?

Man : I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him. They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king.

Brienne : He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head.

Man : I have a question for you both. And I want you to answer it at the same time. I count to three, you both answer. What's his name? One. Two. Three.

Brienne : Two quick deaths.

Jaime Lannister : Those were Stark men.

Brienne : I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Stay.

Catelyn Stark : Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.

Robb Stark : I know that.

Catelyn Stark : And you mean to do it anyway?

Robb Stark : I love her.

Catelyn Stark : I know that seems important to you.

Robb Stark : It is important to me.

Catelyn Stark : Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer.

Robb Stark : And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had?

Catelyn Stark : Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?

Robb Stark : Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.

Catelyn Stark : And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same. If your father lived his life for one thing

Robb Stark : My father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.

Stannis Baratheon : You said you saw my victory in the flames.

Melisandre : l I did. I still see it.

Stannis Baratheon : The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?

Melisandre : The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.

Stannis Baratheon : You claimed to speak for a god.

Melisandre : Will you quit the war just because you've lost a battle?

Stannis Baratheon : You talk about war as if you understand it.

Melisandre : I've been fighting far longer than you.

Stannis Baratheon : Have you? Show me how you fight.

Stannis Baratheon : Show me.

Stannis Baratheon : Where's your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god?

Melisandre : Inside you.

Stannis Baratheon : I murdered my brother.

Melisandre : We murdered him. Share the weight with me.

Stannis Baratheon : He wasn't your brother.

Melisandre : This war has just begun. It will last for years. Thousands will die at your command. You will betray the men serving you. You will betray your family. You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king.

Stannis Baratheon : You promise these things, but you don't know. None of us know.

Melisandre : Let me show you.

Melisandre : Look into the fire, my king. Look.

Stannis Baratheon : I see fire.

Melisandre : Keep looking. Do you see? Do you see, my king?

Stannis Baratheon : Yes.

Theon Greyjoy : I will kill that man. I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall.

Luwin : They want you to know you're surrounded.

Theon Greyjoy : I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.

Luwin : They don't want you to sleep. They want to sap your spirit before

Theon Greyjoy : Thank you, wise bald man. Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me.

Theon Greyjoy : No word from my father?

Luwin : No.

Theon Greyjoy : Send more ravens.

Luwin : You killed all the ravens.

Theon Greyjoy : The first time I saw Winterfell-

Theon Greyjoy : First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, "Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. "We never stood a chance against the man who lives here."

Luwin : Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.

Theon Greyjoy : Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father

Theon Greyjoy : I will kill that man. I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man.

Luwin : Theon, listen to me. I serve Winterfell. Now Winterfell is yours. I'm bound by oath to serve you.

Theon Greyjoy : And what's your counsel, trusted friend?

Luwin : Run. Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls. You have twenty men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run.

Theon Greyjoy : There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family.

Luwin : Don't go home. Join the Night's Watch.

Luwin : Once a man has taken the black, he's beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven.

Theon Greyjoy : I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it ten feet past the Winterfell gates.

Luwin : There are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck...

Luwin : The Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order. You'll have opportunities there.

Theon Greyjoy : The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.

Luwin : The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.

Theon Greyjoy : I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing.

Luwin : I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you're pretending to be. Not yet.

Theon Greyjoy : You may be right. But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.

Theon Greyjoy : You hear that? That's the mating call of the Northmen. They want to fuck us. Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks. I'm ready for one.

Theon Greyjoy : They say every Ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.

Men : Aye!

Theon Greyjoy : You think they're right?

Black Lorren : Aye.

Theon Greyjoy : We die today, brothers. We die bleeding from a hundred wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity. They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves. Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood. Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren. Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle.

Theon Greyjoy : Mothers will name their sons for us.

Theon Greyjoy : Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them.

Theon Greyjoy : And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!

Theon Greyjoy : What is dead may never die!

Men : What is dead may never die!

Black Lorren : Thought he'd never shut up.

Dagmer : It was a good speech. Didn't want to interrupt.

Luwin : What is this? What are you doing?

Dagmer : Let's go home.

Man : Come on.

Tyrion Lannister : Why should I believe you?

Varys : Why would I lie about it?

Tyrion Lannister : To create strife between my sister and me.

Varys : Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man.

Podrick : Yes, my lord?

Tyrion Lannister : Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?

Podrick : No, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times.

Varys : I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch. The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister. It varies from cloak to cloak.

Tyrion Lannister : Then my hill tribesmen.

Varys : Have gone home. Your father paid them quite handsomely. I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.

Varys : We are. Podrick, would you mind?

Varys : There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The king won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget.

Varys : Come along now, Podrick.

Shae : My love.

Tyrion Lannister : It was good of you to come.

Shae : Good of me? Of course I come.

Shae : I want to see you.

Tyrion Lannister : Believe me, you don't.

Shae : Have you looked?

Shae : I will be the first.

Tyrion Lannister : Well?

Shae : You are a mess.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double.

Shae : You think I'm here for money?

Tyrion Lannister : That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me.

Shae : Oh. I'm a poor little rich man and nobody loves me, so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh. Fuck your money. Let's leave.

Tyrion Lannister : Leave?

Shae : Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you. They will try again. Going into wars, fighting soldiers, you're terrible at this. Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back. You don't belong here.

Tyrion Lannister : What would we do in Pentos?

Shae : Eat, drink, fuck, live.

Tyrion Lannister : I want to go with you.

Shae : So do it. Your father, your sister, all these bad people, they can't stop you. Forget about them. Come with me.

Tyrion Lannister : I can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Out-talking them, out-thinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave?

Shae : You have a shit memory. I am yours and you are mine.

Septon : In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity. Look upon one another and say the words.

Robb Stark : Father, smith, warrior, mother ,maiden, crone, stranger.

Talisa : Father, smith, warrior, mother,maiden, crone, stranger.

Robb Stark : I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days.

Talisa : I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days.

Kovarro : A house of ghosts, Khaleesi.

Kovarro : Where are the guards?

Jorah Mormont : No guards. The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel.

Daenerys Targaryen : Let them try.

Daenerys Targaryen : Is this a riddle?

Jorah Mormont : Khaleesi! Khaleesi!

Daenerys Targaryen : Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks? You want me? Here I am. Are you afraid of a little girl?

Hot Pie : How did he find us?

Arya Stark : What are you doing here?

Jaqen Hghar : Waiting for you.

Arya Stark : How did you know we'd come this way?

Jaqen Hghar : After all the things you have seen, this is your question?

Arya Stark : How did you kill those guards? Was it hard?

Jaqen Hghar : No harder than taking a new name, if you know the way.

Arya Stark : Show me how. I want to be able to do it, too.

Jaqen Hghar : If you would learn, you must come with me.

Arya Stark : Where?

Jaqen Hghar : Far and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos.

Arya Stark : My dancing master was from Braavos.

Jaqen Hghar : To be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man, that is something else entirely. The girl has many names on her lips. Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister, llyn Payne, the Hound. Names to offer up to the Red God. She could offer them all one by one.

Arya Stark : I want to. But I can't. I need to find my brother and mother. And my sister. I need to find her, too.

Jaqen Hghar : Then we must part. A man has duties as well. Here.

Arya Stark : What is it?

Jaqen Hghar : A coin of great value.

Arya Stark : Could it buy a horse?

Jaqen Hghar : It is not meant for the buying of horses.

Arya Stark : Then what good is it?

Jaqen Hghar : If the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him, "Valar Morghulis."

Arya Stark : Valar Morghulis.

Arya Stark : Please don't go, Jaqen.

Jaqen Hghar : Jaqen is dead. Say it again. Valar Morghulis.

Jaqen Hghar : Good.

Jaqen Hghar : Farewell, Arya Stark.

Bran Stark : Osha, what are you doing?

Bran Stark : Tell us what medicine to get from your chambers.

Rickon : We'll make you better.

Luwin : I feel just fine.

Bran Stark : They burned it down. They burned everything.

Luwin : Not everything. Not you. But they may come back. You have to go. Put on your warmest clothes. Pack as much food as you can carry and go north.

Osha : North's the wrong way. And mother and brother are south. We don't know where.

Luwin : There are too many enemies in the south. Go to the Wall, to Jon. He'll look after you and let your mother know you're safe.

Bran Stark : I don't want to leave you.

Luwin : No more than I want to leave you. I pulled you into the world. Both of you. I've seen both your faces almost every day since. And for that, I consider myself very, very lucky. Go now with Hodor. Go on. I'll be right here.

Luwin : Osha. You must protect them. You're the only one who can. You may have to protect them against your own kind.

Osha : I've got no great love for my own kind. I'll get you milk of the poppy. Tell me where to find it.

Luwin : I don't want milk of the poppy.

Luwin : Do it quickly.

Drogo : Moon of my life.

Daenerys Targaryen : This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me. Took you from me before I could even Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet. Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands.

Drogo : Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands without you. Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself and came back here to wait for you.

Daenerys Targaryen : That sounds like something you would do.

Drogo : Or maybe it is a dream. Your dream, my dream I do not know. These are questions for wise men with skinny arms.

Drogo : You are the moon of my life. That is all I know and all I need to know.

Drogo : And if this is a dream, I will kill the man who tries to wake me.

Daenerys Targaryen : Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.

Pyatt Pree : They miss their mother.

Pyat Pree : They want to be with you.

Pyat Pree : Do you want to be with them?

Pyat Pree : You will be.

Pyat Pree : When your dragons were born,

Pyat Pree : our magic was born again.

Pyat Pree : It is strongest in their presence.

Pyat Pree : And they are strongest in yours.

Pyat Pree : You will be with them, through winter, summer, winter again. Across a thousand, thousand seasons you will be with them.

Pyat Pree : And we will be with you until time comes to an end.

Pyat Pree : Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.

Daenerys Targaryen : This is not my home. My home is across the sea, where my people are waiting for me.

Pyat Pree : They will be waiting a long time.

Daenerys Targaryen : Dracarys.

Ygritte : We should be there by sundown. Won't be a fun night for you. Mance knows how to make crows sing. If you know what to say, you might just make it through the night. Not talking's not the way to go.

Jon Snow : Careful with that. You might cut yourself.

Jon Snow : Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle.

Rattleshirt : Enough of that!

Jon Snow : Stop!

Qhorin : Why, traitor? So you can give Mance Rayder an invitation to Castle Black?

Rattleshirt : Let 'em fight.

Qhorin : That's it? That's what you can do? You little shit.

Qhorin : Your traitor father teach you that?

Qhorin : Or was it your whore mother?

Qhorin : We are the watchers on the Wall.

Ygritte : You can tell Mance that's the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand.

Rattleshirt : Burn the body.

Wildling : Aye.

Rattleshirt : You don't want this one coming back for you.

Ygritte : Come along, Jon Snow.

Ygritte : Time to meet the King-beyond-the-Wall.

Xaro : What the-

Doreah : Khaleesi, please. He said you'd never leave Qarth alive.

Daenerys Targaryen : Come.

Daenerys Targaryen : Nothing.

Daenerys Targaryen : Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. Thank you for teaching me this lesson.

Xaro : I am king of Qarth. I can help you now, truly help you. We can take the Iron Throne. I'll bring you a thousand ships.

Doreah : Please, Khaleesi, I beg you.

Xaro : All that you have dreamed is within your reach!

Doreah : I beg you, please!

Xaro : Khaleesi.

Doreah : Please! Please!

Xaro : Khaleesi!

Jorah Mormont : It's all a lie.

Daenerys Targaryen : Looks real enough to me. Real enough to buy a ship?

Jorah Mormont : Aye, a small ship.

Jorah Mormont : Take all the gold and jewels.

Grenn : I thought we were coming north to fight wildlings.

Grenn : Is this goat?

Dolorous Edd : It's moose. People shouldn't live anywhere you need to burn shit to keep warm.

Grenn : Well, you see a tree, let me know.

Sam : If you step back and think about it, the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is

Grenn : Just bloody kill me.

Sam : No, truly. The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster's done to her, she's still got hope that life might get better.

Dolorous Edd : The thing about Gilly that you find so interesting is that she said six words to you.

Sam : And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing.

Sam : It's Jon and the Halfhand. They're back.

Grenn : Two blasts is wildlings. You're not fighting them alone.

Dolorous Edd : Come on.

Grenn : Three blasts?

Dolorous Edd : Run!

Sam : Wait! Wait for me!

Sam : Grenn!

Sam : Edd!

Man : Fall back!

Sam : Brother?

Jeor : Did you send the ravens?

Jeor : Tarly, look at me. Did you send the ravens?

Jeor : That was your job. Your only job. We need to get back to the Wall. It's a long march. We know what's out there, but we have to make it, have to warn them or before winter's done, everyone you've ever known will be dead.

Main : CREDITS

Ygritte : First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?

Ygritte : Well, don't stare too long. They're shy. When they stop being shy, they get angry. And when they're angry, I've seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail.

Man : Crow!

Boy : Crow!

Girl : Look over there!

Girl : Crow! Look over here! Look!

Woman : Ah, look, crow coming!

Ygritte : You're wearing the wrong color.

Jon Snow : Mance was a ranger.

Ygritte : In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free.

Jon Snow : When I'm free, will I be free to go?

Ygritte : Sure, you will.

Boy : Oh!

Ygritte : And I'll be free to kill you. Got no respect, this lot. Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul.

Jon Snow : What happened to their fathers?

Ygritte : Some of them were killed by crows like you. Don't look so grim, Jon Snow. If Mance Rayder likes you, you'll live another day. And if he don't...

Tormund : I smell a crow.

Rattleshirt : We killed his friends. Thought you'd want to question this one.

Tormund : What do we want with a baby crow?

Ygritte : This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand. He wants to be one of us.

Tormund : That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.

Jon Snow : My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.

Tormund : Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What's your name, boy?

Jon Snow : Jon Snow.

Jon Snow : Your Grace.

Tormund : Your Grace? Did you hear that? From now on, you'd better kneel every time I fart.

Mance : Stand, boy. We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.

Mance : So, you're Ned Stark's bastard. Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones. You can leave us.

Mance : The girl likes you. You like her back, Snow? That why you want to join us?

Tormund : Don't panic, boy. This isn't the damned Night's Watch where we make you swear off girls.

Mance : This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.

Tormund : Can't believe this pup killed the Halfhand.

Mance : He was our enemy and I'm glad he's dead.

Mance : He was my brother once. Back when he had a whole hand. What were you doing with him?

Jon Snow : The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.

Mance : Why?

Jon Snow : He wants me to lead one day.

Mance : But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-Beyond-the-Wall.

Jon Snow : If I'm a traitor, then you are, too.

Mance : Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?

Jon Snow : I want to be free.

Mance : No, I don't think so. I think what you want most of all is to be a hero. I'll ask you one last time ... why do you want to join us?

Jon Snow : We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...

Mance : You saw what?

Jon Snow : I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.

Mance : You're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers?

Jon Snow : Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?

Mance : We'll need to find you a new cloak.

Bronn : What if you took off that bit there?

Whore : Don't you want to leave something to the imagination?

Bronn : Trouble is, I've never had much imagination.

Whore : I want you to take it off.

Whore : Mouth.

Podrick : Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.

Bronn : I didn't hear that.

Podrick : Apologies, ser.

Bronn : Back away. Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment. Then back away some more.

Podrick : Lord Tyrion sent me.

Bronn : I will murder you, boy.

Podrick : He said it was a matter of life and death.

Tyrion Lannister : Pod?

Cersei Lannister : It's your sister. The queen.

Tyrion Lannister : What are they doing here?

Cersei Lannister : Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?

Tyrion Lannister : No, I don't think so.

Cersei Lannister : If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?

Tyrion Lannister : They stay outside.

Cersei Lannister : I'm not afraid of you, little brother.

Tyrion Lannister : Why are you here?

Cersei Lannister : I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that.

Tyrion Lannister : The man who cut me lost more than his nose.

Cersei Lannister : I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father.

Tyrion Lannister : Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me.

Cersei Lannister : No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.

Tyrion Lannister : Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.

Cersei Lannister : You're meeting Father today?

Tyrion Lannister : How do you know that?

Cersei Lannister : Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?

Tyrion Lannister : What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came.

Cersei Lannister : You're going to make me cry.

Tyrion Lannister : Why do you care what I want from him?

Cersei Lannister : Because you've slandered me to Father before.

Tyrion Lannister : Slandered? When?

Cersei Lannister : You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.

Tyrion Lannister : You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe.

Cersei Lannister : I was nine, too.

Tyrion Lannister : She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.

Cersei Lannister : If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not slander if it's true.

Cersei Lannister : And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?

Tyrion Lannister : Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?

Cersei Lannister : Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey.

Tyrion Lannister : Any lies in particular?

Cersei Lannister : You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are.

Tyrion Lannister : Still makes me more clever than you.

Bronn : Oh, look at these two shining warriors. Ser Taryn Mant and... Ser Whosit of Whocares.

Meryn Trant : Ser Meryn Trant.

Bronn : Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

Meryn Trant : You're no knight.

Bronn : Pod.

Podrick : Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself.

Meryn Trant : You're an up-jumped cutthroat, nothing more.

Bronn : That's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion.

Meryn Trant : You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand.

Bronn : As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me.

Tyrion Lannister : A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.

Bronn : I've been doing that for a while now.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you grow bored protecting me?

Bronn : I grow poor protecting you.

Tyrion Lannister : Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch.

Bronn : Briefly.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm sure you filled your pockets.

Bronn : And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more.

Tyrion Lannister : I thought we were friends.

Bronn : We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.

Tyrion Lannister : How much?

Bronn : Double.

Tyrion Lannister : Double?

Bronn : I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.

Bronn : Which means you can afford it.

Davos : Here. Here! Help me!

Man : Who are you?

Davos : I was in the battle at Blackwater. I was a captain and a knight.

Man : Aye, ser, and serving which king?

Davos : The one true king of Westeros... Stannis Baratheon.

Salladhor : I thought you were dead. Everyone thought you were dead. And your son?

Salladhor : He may have swam ashore as you did.

Davos : No, the wildfire took him. I saw it.

Salladhor : I'm so sorry, my friend. I, too, have lost a son. There is nothing worse in this world. But, Davos, you were a good father.

Davos : If I was a good father, he'd still be here. Stannis lives?

Salladhor : He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.

Davos : Will you take me there?

Salladhor : There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.

Davos : This war is not over.

Salladhor : Not for you, maybe. But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.

Davos : We're both sworn to King Stannis.

Salladhor : I am sworn to no man. I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory. I delivered the ships.

Davos : Stannis never gives up. Never. Now he will regroup ...

Salladhor : He's a broken man. His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay. They say he sees no one ... not his generals, not even his wife. Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive.

Davos : What?

Salladhor : They built a great fire when Stannis returned. All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness. They say she sang to them as they burned.

Salladhor : I'm a pirate.

Davos : You're a smuggler.

Salladhor : Servants of darkness. I'm thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.

Davos : Take me back there, please.

Salladhor : You cannot turn Stannis against her.

Davos : Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.

Salladhor : You could try. If you fail, they will burn you. If you succeed, they'll burn you. And you've only just come back to life. Stay alive a little longer, my friend.

Davos : You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.

Salladhor : And you drank with me on four of my wedding days, but I don't ask you for favors.

Davos : I have to stop her. Please, do this for me.

Salladhor : When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck.

Roose Bolton : We should set the siege lines a thousand yards from Harrenhal.

Robb Stark : There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.

Roose Bolton : I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend.

Robb Stark : The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.

Rickard Karstark : Two hundred Northmen slaughtered like sheep.

Roose Bolton : The debt will be repaid, my friend. For them and for your sons.

Rickard Karstark : Will it? They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.

Roose Bolton : The Kingslayer won't remain free for long. My best hunters are after him.

Robb Stark : A Mallister?

Catelyn Stark : Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman.

Robb Stark : Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.

Talisa : She's your mother.

Robb Stark : She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.

Qyburn : Water. Water.

Talisa : This needs to be cleaned and closed.

Robb Stark : What's your name, friend?

Qyburn : Qyburn.

Talisa : You're lucky to be alive.

Qyburn : Lucky?

Tyrion Lannister : The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?

Tywin Lannister : Am I enjoying it?

Tyrion Lannister : I was very happy as Hand of the King.

Tywin Lannister : Yes. I heard how happy you were.

Tywin Lannister : blows on his paper to dry the ink.

Tywin Lannister : You brought a whore into my bed.

Tyrion Lannister : It wasn't your bed at the time.

Tywin Lannister : I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.

Tyrion Lannister : Occasionally I drank with the harlots.

Tywin Lannister : What do you want, Tyrion?

Tyrion Lannister : Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.

Tywin Lannister : Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.

Tyrion Lannister : I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start.

Tywin Lannister : Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want.

Tyrion Lannister : I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir.

Tywin Lannister : You want Casterly Rock?

Tyrion Lannister : It is mine by right.

Tywin Lannister : We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.

Tyrion Lannister : Why?

Tywin Lannister : Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go.

Tywin Lannister : Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed, I'll hang.

Sansa Stark : Dorne. It's going to Dorne.

Shae : Why Dorne?

Sansa Stark : It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.

Shae : I met some people in Dorne who weren't so beautiful and warm.

Sansa Stark : Don't ruin the game.

Shae : I told you, I don't want to play.

Sansa Stark : What about that one there?

Shae : That one? It's going to Volantis.

Sansa Stark : Why?

Shae : Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one.

Sansa Stark : That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.

Shae : Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?

Sansa Stark : Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.

Petyr Baelish : Lovely day for it. Watching the ships.

Sansa Stark : Lord Baelish.

Petyr Baelish : Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?

Petyr Baelish : I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.

Sansa Stark : Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.

Petyr Baelish : You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...

Sansa Stark : I won't tell anyone.

Petyr Baelish : How do I know?

Sansa Stark : Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when.

Petyr Baelish : I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice.

Ros : You're her handmaiden?

Shae : Yes. And you're his...?

Ros : I help manage his affairs.

Shae : He's an important person.

Ros : So is she. I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle. The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset. We've both done rather well, you and I.

Shae : Yes.

Ros : Given where we started.

Shae : And where is that?

Ros : It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out. Watch out for her.

Shae : I always do.

Ros : Watch out for her with him.

Jorah Mormont : They're growing fast.

Daenerys Targaryen : Not fast enough. I can't wait that long. I need an army

Jorah Mormont : We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.

Daenerys Targaryen : The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people.

Jorah Mormont : Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?

Daenerys Targaryen : It's too beautiful a day to argue.

Jorah Mormont : You're right. Another lovely day on the high seas.

Daenerys Targaryen : Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ...

Jorah Mormont : The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi. You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong. And not before.

Davos : Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : I heard you were dead.

Davos : Not yet.

Stannis Baratheon : I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : We are alone.

Davos : Your Grace, you are the rightful king. Not only by blood. You're an honorable man, a just man. And there is still a war to fight.

Stannis Baratheon : I am fighting.

Davos : By burning prisoners alive?

Melisandre : How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?

Davos : I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone.

Melisandre : I'm not your enemy.

Davos : You are my enemy.

Melisandre : Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them.

Melisandre : Don't despair, Ser Davos. What I told your son is true.

Melisandre : Death by fire is the purest death.

Davos : This woman is evil! She's the mother of demons.

Stannis Baratheon : Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.

Davos : Your Grace!

Guard : Come on.

Melisandre : You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos.

Davos : She will destroy us all!

Melisandre : I will pray for you.

Guard : Guard

Guard : Guard #2

Joffrey Lannister : Why have we stopped?

Guard : It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : What is she doing? Who gave her permission?

Maid : My lady. We should have guards, my lady.

Margaery Tyrell : Why?

Margaery Tyrell : Pardon me.

Maid : Stop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress.

Margaery Tyrell : I have others.

Guard : Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace?

Joffrey Lannister : No.

Child : He was a soldier. He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay. He never came back.

Margaery Tyrell : And your mother?

Child : She died when she had me.

Margaery Tyrell : Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them.

Margaery Tyrell : Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father.

Child : He wasn't a knight. He was just a soldier.

Margaery Tyrell : And what do knights swear to do? Protect the weak and uphold the good. Your father did that. Be proud of him.

Margaery Tyrell : Was your father a soldier, too?

Margaery Tyrell : You should be proud, too. Under King Joffrey's leadership, your fathers saved the city. They saved us all. From now on, we're going to take care of you. All of you.

Margaery Tyrell : Come to me for whatever you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them. Directly to me.

Margaery Tyrell : Your Grace.

Loras : Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : Please, sit. Sit. I do apologize, my lady. Small council meetings. At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time?

Joffrey Lannister : That's a lovely gown, my lady.

Cersei Lannister : Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold.

Margaery Tyrell : The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?

Margaery Tyrell : I am touched by your concern, Your Grace. Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm. Doesn't it, Loras?

Loras : Yes.

Margaery Tyrell : Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it.

Cersei Lannister : You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.

Margaery Tyrell : Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.

Loras : Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.

Margaery Tyrell : The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.

Cersei Lannister : An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life.

Joffrey Lannister : My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger.

Cersei Lannister : You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery.

Margaery Tyrell : Hunger turns men into beasts. I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard. They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need.

Joffrey Lannister : Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of... charitable work before. I'm sure she knows what she's doing.

Cersei Lannister : I'm sure she does.

Missandei : The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water.

Missandei : They will stand until they drop.

Missandei : Such is their obedience.

Daenerys Targaryen : They may suit my needs. Tell me of their training.

Missandei : The Westrosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise to keep the price down. She wished to know how they are trained.

Kraznys Mo Nakloz : Tell her what she would know and be quick about it.

Missandei : They begin their training at five. Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears. Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training.

Missandei : Their discipline and loyalty are absolute. They fear nothing.

Jorah Mormont : Even the bravest men fear death.

Missandei : The knight says even brave men fear death.

Kraznys Mo Nakloz : Tell the old man he smells of piss.

Missandei : Truly, master?

Kraznys Mo Nakloz : No, not truly. Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing?

Missandei : My master says the Unsullied are not men. Death means nothing to them.

Kraznys Mo Nakloz : Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner to open her eyes and watch.

Missandei : He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : Tell the good master there is no need.

Kraznys Mo Nakloz : She's worried about their nipples? Doers the dumb bitch know we've cut off their balls?

Missandei : My master points out that men don't need nipples.

Kraznys Mo Nakloz : Here, I'm done with you.

Unsullied : This one is pleased to have served you.

Missandei : To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn, and kill it before its mother's eyes. This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them.

Daenerys Targaryen : You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?

Missandei : She is offended. She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby.

Kraznys Mo Nakloz : What a soft mewling fool this one is.

Missandei : My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby's owner, not the mother.

Daenerys Targaryen : How many do you have to sell?

Missandei : Eight thousand.

Kraznys Mo Nakloz : Tell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow.

Missandei : Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry. Many other buyers are interested.

Daenerys Targaryen : Eight thousand dead babies.

Jorah Mormont : The Unsullied are a means to an end.

Daenerys Targaryen : Once I own them, these men...

Jorah Mormont : They're not men. Not anymore.

Daenerys Targaryen : Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?

Jorah Mormont : Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?

Jorah Mormont : You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.

Jorah Mormont : You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it.

Daenerys Targaryen : The warlocks.

Daenerys Targaryen : I owe you my life, Ser.

Barristan : The honor is mine, my queen.

Daenerys Targaryen : You know this man?

Jorah Mormont : I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.

Barristan : King Robert is dead. I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness. I was sworn to protect your family. I failed them.

Jon Snow : Don't think too much, Bran.

Jon Snow : Relax your bow arm.

Eddard Stark : And which one of you was a marksman at ten?

Bran Stark : Father?

Jojen : You can't kill it, you know.

Bran Stark : Why not?

Jojen : Because the raven is you.

Hodor : Hodor.

Bran Stark : It's all right, Hodor.

Osha : Were you inside the wolf again, little lord?

Bran Stark : No, it was the three-eyed raven.

Osha : He's back.

Bran Stark : I tried to kill it, but I couldn't. There was a boy.

Osha : I don't want to hear about it.

Bran Stark : But you asked.

Osha : We've got plenty of worries. We don't need to pour black magic on top of them.

Bran Stark : I didn't ask for black magic dreams.

Osha : I know you didn't, little lord.

Osha : We need to move.

Bran Stark : We don't know who might be after us. No one even knows we're alive.

Osha : And who told you that? The three-eyed raven tell you?

Bran Stark : No.

Osha : Some good he is, then.

Osha : I don't know what other people know and what they don't. I only know the Wall is a long way off.

Talisa : My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot. Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds.

Robb Stark : Did you ever think you'd marry one?

Talisa : I never thought I'd marry anyone at all.

Robb Stark : Never?

Talisa : Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians.

Roose Bolton : Pardon me, Your Grace. My queen.

Talisa : Lord Bolton.

Robb Stark : Let me guess which one is the good news.

Roose Bolton : Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.

Catelyn Stark : I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many.

Robb Stark : We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.

Catelyn Stark : Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?

Catelyn Stark : Something else?

Robb Stark : By the time Bolton's bastard Ramsay got to Winterfell, the Ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages.

Catelyn Stark : Have you received any demands?

Robb Stark : No.

Catelyn Stark : Have you heard anything from Theon at all?

Theon Greyjoy : Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?

Torturer : I want to do this.

Jaime Lannister : Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?

Brienne : Yes.

Jaime Lannister : So how shall we pass the time?

Brienne : By putting one foot in front of the other.

Jaime Lannister : It's going to be a very dull walk.

Brienne : I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.

Jaime Lannister : You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword.

Brienne : If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman.

Jaime Lannister : All the good it's done her.

Jaime Lannister : How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.

Brienne : Not your concern, Kingslayer.

Jaime Lannister : It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.

Brienne : How would you know?

Jaime Lannister : Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.

Brienne : Move.

Jaime Lannister : Were you pledged to Stannis?

Brienne : Gods, no.

Jaime Lannister : Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal.

Brienne : Shut your mouth.

Jaime Lannister : Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you.

Brienne : I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king.

Jaime Lannister : Sounds like you quite fancied him.

Brienne : I did not fancy him.

Jaime Lannister : Oh, gods, you did.

Jaime Lannister : Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid.

Jaime Lannister : He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.

Brienne : I'm not interested in foul rumors.

Jaime Lannister : Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.

Brienne : Shut your mouth!

Jaime Lannister : I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love.

Man : Where are you headed, then?

Brienne : South. You?

Man : Riverrun. Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go. You can't win.

Jaime Lannister : No, you really can't.

Man : Looks like you're safe enough, though. Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldn't tangle with you. Seven blessings to you.

Brienne : And you.

Jaime Lannister : He knows who I am.

Brienne : He doesn't.

Jaime Lannister : Maybe you're right. But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?

Brienne : We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.

Jaime Lannister : More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?

Joffrey Lannister : Make it tighter here.

Cersei Lannister : That's better. It makes you look very strong.

Joffrey Lannister : No flowers. I said no flowers. All these are wrong. Bring others.

Tailor : Yes, Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : Bloody flowers. On the king.

Cersei Lannister : Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.

Cersei Lannister : Tell me what you think of her.

Joffrey Lannister : Who?

Cersei Lannister : Margaery.

Joffrey Lannister : She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century.

Cersei Lannister : It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent.

Joffrey Lannister : Yes, she is.

Cersei Lannister : Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.

Joffrey Lannister : Not to me.

Cersei Lannister : I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.

Joffrey Lannister : This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.

Cersei Lannister : Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.

Joffrey Lannister : She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-what they're told.

Cersei Lannister : You need to ask yourself

Joffrey Lannister : I don't need to do anything.

Joffrey Lannister : Better. Much better.

Shae : I still don't believe it.

Sansa Stark : He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.

Shae : Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.

Sansa Stark : Littlefinger's not in love with me.

Shae : Love is not the thing he wants.

Sansa Stark : He's too old.

Shae : They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...?

Sansa Stark : No.

Shae : If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me.

Sansa Stark : Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.

Guard : Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.

Sansa Stark : Send him in.

Loras : Lady Sansa.

Sansa Stark : Ser Loras.

Loras : My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother, the Lady Olenna, in the gardens. May I escort you to them?

Loras : I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa.

Sansa Stark : You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hando s tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose.

Loras : Of course I did.

Margaery Tyrell : It's more your color. You take it.

Maid : Thank you.

Margaery Tyrell : You're such a dear.

Loras : I'll take my leave. Lady Sansa.

Sansa Stark : Thank you, Ser Loras.

Margaery Tyrell : Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.

Olenna Tyrell : Kiss me, child.

Olenna Tyrell : It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.

Sansa Stark : And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant.

Olenna Tyrell : Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.

Margaery Tyrell : Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras.

Olenna Tyrell : Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-

Margaery Tyrell : Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?

Olenna Tyrell : She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?

Sansa Stark : Lemon cake's my favorite.

Olenna Tyrell : So we've been told. Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others.

Olenna Tyrell : Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?

Sansa Stark : I haven't had the pleasure.

Olenna Tyrell : No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey.

Sansa Stark : I-, I-

Olenna Tyrell : You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?

Olenna Tyrell : Has he ripped out your tongue?

Sansa Stark : Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion

Olenna Tyrell : Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?

Margaery Tyrell : I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.

Olenna Tyrell : Bring me some cheese.

Servant : The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady.

Olenna Tyrell : The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.

Olenna Tyrell : Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you.

Sansa Stark : My father always told the truth.

Olenna Tyrell : Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head.

Sansa Stark : Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.

Olenna Tyrell : Go on.

Sansa Stark : I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.

Margaery Tyrell : She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her.

Olenna Tyrell : Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it.

Sansa Stark : He's a monster.

Olenna Tyrell : Ah. That's a pity.

Sansa Stark : Please, don't stop the wedding.

Olenna Tyrell : Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese.

Rickard Karstark : We're at war. This march is a distraction.

Robb Stark : My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.

Rickard Karstark : Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?

Rickard Karstark : Then it's a distraction.

Robb Stark : My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men.

Rickard Karstark : Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference.

Robb Stark : Have you lost faith in our cause?

Rickard Karstark : If it's revenge, I still got faith in it.

Robb Stark : If you no longer believe-

Rickard Karstark : I can believe till it snows in Dorne. Don't change the fact that we've got half the men.

Robb Stark : You don't think we can win?

Rickard Karstark : May I speak my mind, Your Grace?

Robb Stark : Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?

Rickard Karstark : I think you lost this war the day you married her.

Talisa : Whoa, whoa.

Man : Your Grace.

Catelyn Stark : You're afraid of her. And she knows it.

Talisa : I'm not afraid of her. May I help you, Lady Stark?

Catelyn Stark : No.

Talisa : I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-

Catelyn Stark : You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them.

Talisa : You've made them before?

Catelyn Stark : Twice.

Talisa : Did they work?

Catelyn Stark : After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.

Catelyn Stark : Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering.

Talisa : Which boy?

Catelyn Stark : Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us.

Talisa : And he lived.

Catelyn Stark : And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.

Mance : Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?

Jon Snow : Yes.

Mance : You liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you. I've got wildling blood in my veins. These are my people.

Jon Snow : I understand.

Mance : Well, how could you understand?

Jon Snow : You want to protect your people.

Mance : Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?

Jon Snow : No.

Mance : I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south. Because that's the truth.

Tormund : Shouldn't be long now.

Jon Snow : What's wrong with him?

Mance : He's a warg. He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes. He's scouting for us.

Ygritte : What, you've never met a warg?

Mance : Orell.

Mance : Where were you this time?

Orell : The Fist of the First Men.

Mance : What did you see?

Orell : Dead crows.

Rast : What's the matter, Piggy? You crying 'cause you're cold? There's 200 brothers killed by dead men and you're still here whimpering. That seem fair to you? I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole. Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh? You know you want to.

Grenn : Hey. Get up, Sam.

Sam : No.

Grenn : Get up.

Sam : I can't.

Grenn : If you stop, you'll die.

Dolorous Edd : Course if you don't stop, you'll probably die, too.

Sam : You don't care.

Dolorous Edd : Course we care.

Sam : You left me. When the white walkers came, you left me.

Dolorous Edd : Aye, we left you. You're fat and you're slow. We didn't want to die.

Grenn : Help me get him up.

Rast : Looks like that piggy is done for.

Grenn : Help us get him up.

Rast : He's slowing us down.

Grenn : Just get him up!

Rast : Why? So the rest of us can die? We'll move faster without him.

Jeor : What is this? Get up, Tarly. Is he all right?

Grenn : Aye, I think so.

Rast : If he can't, we may as well just go without him.

Jeor : That's enough. Tarly, I forbid you to die. Do you hear me?

Rast : Why should the rest of us-

Jeor : Rast, you're responsible for him.

Rast : What am I supposed to do?

Jeor : Make sure he gets back alive. If he doesn't, you don't. Move on!

Rast : I'm not dying for you, Piggy. You hear me?

Bran Stark : Where's Rickon and Hodor?

Osha : Looking for food.

Bran Stark : What's out there?

Osha : Not another step, boy. Unless you want to drown in your own blood.

Jojen : I'm unarmed.

Osha : That was poor planning.

Jojen : My sister carries the weapons.

Meera : I'm better with them. Drop the spear.

Meera : Drop it.

Osha : If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits.

Jojen : You must be SUMMER.

Jojen : I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister Meera. We've come a long way to find you, Brandon. And we have much farther to go.

Gendry Baratheon : I'm just trying to understand.

Arya Stark : Would you please shut up about it?

Gendry Baratheon : Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.

Arya Stark : I'm not listening.

Gendry Baratheon : But just explain it to me. He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead. All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey.

Arya Stark : Shut up.

Gendry Baratheon : You could have picked Tywin Lannister.

Arya Stark : Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?

Gendry Baratheon : But you could have ended the war.

Arya Stark : Where are we going?

Gendry Baratheon : North.

Arya Stark : If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now.

Gendry Baratheon : Maybe we already passed it.

Arya Stark : It's a hundred feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather, he's a lord. He'll protect us.

Gendry Baratheon : Could be a minstrel.

Thoros : A lion still has claws...

Hot Pie : A minstrel's got gold sometimes. We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food.

Arya Stark : Shh.

Thoros : And so he spoke, and so he spoke

Thoros : What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?

Anguy : Just a dirty little cub, I think.

Thoros : Loose a few more shafts.

Arya Stark : Don't.

Thoros : Put the sword down, girl.

Arya Stark : You go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won't kill you.

Anguy : Generous.

Thoros : You're a dangerous person. I like dangerous people. Why are your friends so shy?

Arya Stark : What friends?

Anguy : The fat to your left and the lad beside him.

Thoros : Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords. You escape from Harrenhal?

Arya Stark : Who are you?

Thoros : Thoros of Myr. And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.

Arya Stark : No, who do you fight for?

Thoros : The Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.

Hot Pie : I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us.

Thoros : You've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way.

Anguy : Here's the thing, fat

Anguy : When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head. So I advise you move, because I'm done talking.

Anguy : Half the country's starving and look at this one.

Thoros : Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving.

Shae : My lion.

Tyrion Lannister : We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.

Shae : But you said I should come to you with any problems.

Tyrion Lannister : Did anyone see you? No.

Shae : No.

Tyrion Lannister : You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.

Tyrion Lannister : All right. What is this problem?

Shae : I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him.

Tyrion Lannister : Baelish doesn't have friends.

Shae : I don't know her name.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, Ros? The redhead?

Shae : How do you know her?

Tyrion Lannister : I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.

Shae : She's a whore.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things.

Shae : You fucked her.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice.

Tyrion Lannister : But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else.

Shae : And was she good? Did you like her?

Tyrion Lannister : Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?

Shae : That Sansa shouldn't trust him.

Tyrion Lannister : Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?

Shae : We have to protect her.

Tyrion Lannister : We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name.

Shae : A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you.

Shae : You pervert. You want her? This child?

Tyrion Lannister : I don't even want to talk about her.

Shae : But you are.

Tyrion Lannister : Only because you're making me.

Shae : I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.

Tyrion Lannister : This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.

Shae : Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me.

Tyrion Lannister : Hmm, yes.

Shae : Now do you think I'm cruel?

Tyrion Lannister : Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.

Guard : Lady Tyrell, my king.

Joffrey Lannister : Send her in.

Margaery Tyrell : You wanted to see me, Your Grace?

Joffrey Lannister : I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.

Margaery Tyrell : That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want.

Joffrey Lannister : Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.

Margaery Tyrell : A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.

Joffrey Lannister : And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?

Margaery Tyrell : Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all.

Joffrey Lannister : What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?

Margaery Tyrell : The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.

Joffrey Lannister : You failed to do this.

Margaery Tyrell : Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?

Margaery Tyrell : No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.

Joffrey Lannister : What makes you say this?

Margaery Tyrell : Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me.

Joffrey Lannister : No, he was a known degenerate.

Margaery Tyrell : It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.

Margaery Tyrell : As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.

Margaery Tyrell : You are the king.

Joffrey Lannister : Yes. I am.

Joffrey Lannister : Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.

Margaery Tyrell : It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?

Joffrey Lannister : It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.

Joffrey Lannister : The bolt goes here.

Joffrey Lannister : And then you just aim and-

Margaery Tyrell : Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman.

Joffrey Lannister : It's not unheard of.

Margaery Tyrell : My father would never let me before-

Joffrey Lannister : You no longer belong to him. Do you want to hold it?

Margaery Tyrell : May I? Please.

Margaery Tyrell : I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.

Joffrey Lannister : Could you do it? Could you kill something?.

Margaery Tyrell : I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?

Joffrey Lannister : Yes.

Margaery Tyrell : Would you like to watch me?

Theon Greyjoy : Stop! Stop!

Torturer : Tell us the truth.

Theon Greyjoy : About what?

Theon Greyjoy : I don't know what you want.

Torturer : I want the truth.

Theon Greyjoy : What truth?

Torturer : Why'd you take Winterfell?

Theon Greyjoy : I took it to-I took it-

Torturer : Who gave the orders?

Theon Greyjoy : No one. I took it on my own.

Torturer : Why?

Theon Greyjoy : To take the North while it was vulnerable.

Torturer : What were you going to do once you took it?

Theon Greyjoy : Hold it. Rule it.

Torturer : Good. That's very good.

Theon Greyjoy : Why did you do that?

Torturer : I told you. Why did you take Winterfell?

Theon Greyjoy : I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.

Theon Greyjoy : Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them.

Theon Greyjoy : What are you doing?

Theon Greyjoy : Please.

Theon Greyjoy : I'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off.

Ramsay Bolton : Your sister sent me.

Theon Greyjoy : Yara?

Ramsay Bolton : I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.

Theon Greyjoy : No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go.

Osha : Rickon, stay with us.

Bran Stark : It's all right. The wolves will protect him.

Jojen : You can get inside his head, see through his eyes.

Bran Stark : Only when I'm asleep.

Jojen : That's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg.

Bran Stark : It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a-

Jojen : A three-eyed raven?

Bran Stark : You've seen it?

Jojen : We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?

Bran Stark : Does it have anything to do with warging?

Jojen : No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight.

Bran Stark : Seeing things that haven't happened yet?

Jojen : Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.

Osha : What's he telling him?

Meera : Why don't you ask?

Osha : Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?

Meera : Where's the shame in that?

Osha : Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.

Meera : Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.

Bran Stark : When my father died, I dreamt it.

Jojen : You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.

Bran Stark : You have the sight, too?

Jojen : When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry.

Bran Stark : Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah.

Jojen : Yeah.

Bran Stark : He saved my father's life during the rebellion.

Jojen : Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too.

Bran Stark : What else have you seen?

Jojen : Only one thing that matters-you.

Man : I never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle. Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand.

Arya Stark : I don't drink ale.

Thoros : There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.

Man : Yeah!

Thoros : You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children-

Arya Stark : We're not children.

Thoros : How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?

Arya Stark : Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.

Thoros : A smith, eh? Where'd you train?

Gendry Baratheon : King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.

Thoros : That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.

Gendry Baratheon : That's because he's twice as good.

Thoros : Aha! A smith and a salesman.

Arya Stark : Gendry stole us weapons.

Thoros : Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see.

Arya Stark : He knows how to use a sword and so do I.

Arya Stark : My brothers taught me.

Men : Ooh!

Thoros : To your brothers!

Thoros : You can finish your meals before you go. It may be awhile before you see another.

Arya Stark : You'll free us?

Thoros : I gave you my word.

Thoros : But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your-

Anguy : Hey, hey.

Thoros : Now that is an uncommonly large person. How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?

Anguy : One waits for him to drink until he passes out.

Thoros : Poor man. You have my sympathy.

Thoros : Aha, not a man at all. A Hound!

Thoros : So good to see you again, Clegane.

Sandor Clegane : Thoros? The fuck you doing here?

Thoros : Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever.

Thoros : A pretty prize, lads.

Men : Yeah!

Sandor Clegane : Girl.

Sandor Clegane : What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?

Jaime Lannister : It's a tough decision - take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.

Brienne : Silence, Kingslayer.

Jaime Lannister : Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river.

Brienne : Good luck.

Jaime Lannister : It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?

Jaime Lannister : Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.

Brienne : Be quick about it.

Jaime Lannister : I need to rest.

Brienne : Get up.

Jaime Lannister : I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?

Brienne : Get up now.

Jaime Lannister : Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year.

Jaime Lannister : This heel is ruined. There's no way-

Jaime Lannister : I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.

Jaime Lannister : Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.

Jaime Lannister : You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.

Jaime Lannister : Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you.

Jaime Lannister : You're good. Graceless, but good.

Jaime Lannister : See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there.

Locke : Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman.

Jaime Lannister : We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.

Locke : You sure he's the one?

Man : That's him, all right. I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.

Locke : Give the man his silver.

Jaime Lannister : Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.

Locke : Enough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off. I'd rather he takes yours.

Edmure : If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing-

Brynden : Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And don't call him "nephew." He is your king.

Edmure : Robb knows I meant him no disr-

Brynden : You're lucky I'm not your king. I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.

Edmure : My blunder sent Tywin's mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles. No, there's glory enough to go around.

Robb Stark : It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.

Edmure : I seized an opportunity.

Robb Stark : What value was the mill?

Edmure : The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.

Robb Stark : Is he there now? Of course not.

Edmure : We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.

Robb Stark : I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill.

Edmure : We took hostages. Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.

Robb Stark : Willem and Martyn Lannister are fourteen years old.

Brynden : Martyn is fifteen, I believe.

Robb Stark : Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?

Edmure : No.

Robb Stark : Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?

Robb Stark : How many men did you lose?

Edmure : But for every man we lost, the Lannisters-

Robb Stark : We need our men more than Tywin needs his!

Edmure : I'm sorry. I didn't know.

Robb Stark : You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.

Brynden : We seem to be running short of patience here.

Robb Stark : You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister : Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.

Tywin Lannister : What news of Jaime?

Tywin Lannister : Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?

Varys : We are trying, my lord.

Tywin Lannister : Try harder. What do we have, then?

Varys : Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name.

Tywin Lannister : Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

Petyr Baelish : For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord. Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been positively predisposed toward me.

Pycelle : A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.

Petyr Baelish : Titles do seem to breed titles.

Tywin Lannister : You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.

Tyrion Lannister : Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended.

Tywin Lannister : Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.

Tyrion Lannister : Master of Coin?

Tywin Lannister : It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it.

Cersei Lannister : I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.

Pycelle : Hear, hear.

Men : He lifted her high in the air. He sniffed and roared and smelled her there. She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair. But he licked the honey from her hair. From there to here, from here to there. All black and brown and covered with hair. He smelled that girl in the summer air. The bear, the bear and the maiden fair.

Jaime Lannister : I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us.

Brienne : You were armed when we were taken.

Jaime Lannister : I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.

Brienne : All my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.' You were slower than I expected. And more predictable.

Jaime Lannister : I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.

Brienne : And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.

Jaime Lannister : You were not beating me.

Brienne : Maybe you were as good as people said once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.

Jaime Lannister : When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist.

Brienne : Would I?

Jaime Lannister : They'll knock your teeth out.

Brienne : You think I care about my teeth?

Jaime Lannister : No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?

Brienne : What does it matter?

Jaime Lannister : Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.

Brienne : If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted?

Jaime Lannister : If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods.

Gendry Baratheon : If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new.

Thoros : Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.

Arya Stark : Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?

Thoros : You're not our prisoner, little lady.

Arya Stark : What am I?

Thoros : Our guest. No one's put any chains on you.

Arya Stark : So I can walk away, then?

Thoros : These woods aren't safe for Ned Stark's daughter. You're lucky we found you.

Sandor Clegane : You think you're good with that bow, you little twat?

Anguy : Better than anyone you've ever met.

Sandor Clegane : A cowardo s weapon. I like to fight up close. I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.

Anguy : Why? So you can kiss him?

Arya Stark : You remember the last time you were here?

Sandor Clegane : Looks like every other shit inn on the road.

Anguy : Now, apologies, but you're one ugly fucker and I'd rather not see you no more.

Anguy : Watch your head. Off we go.

Driver : Walk up!

Arya Stark : What are you doing? We're about to leave.

Hot Pie : I'm staying.

Gendry Baratheon : You're what?

Hot Pie : I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better. Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him. Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants. My brother ain't no king. I'm not a Stark of "Winterhell".

Arya Stark : Winterfell.

Hot Pie : You sure?

Arya Stark : I'm sure.

Hot Pie : Well, I made you something.

Arya Stark : What is it?

Hot Pie : It's a wolf.

Gendry Baratheon : Yes, it is.

Arya Stark : That's the tail?

Hot Pie : Yeah.

Gendry Baratheon : Well, be safe.

Hot Pie : Yeah, you, too. Don't get stabbed.

Gendry Baratheon : You don't burn your fingers.

Arya Stark : Good-bye, Hot Pie.

Hot Pie : Good-bye, Arry.

Man : Up you go, little lady.

Arya Stark : Hey, Hot Pie. It's really good.

Catelyn Stark : A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.

Brynden : It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening.

Catelyn Stark : I've missed you, Uncle. Father missed you, too, from the day you left. Maybe he never said it in so many words-

Brynden : Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox. I was surprised when he died. Didn't think death had the patience.

Catelyn Stark : I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end?

Brynden : After thirty years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it. He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish. He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with. I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name.

Catelyn Stark : Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. 'Wait for me, little Cat,' he'd say. 'Wait for me and I'll come back to you.' And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return. I will never see them again.

Brynden : You mustn't think it. We don't know the truth. They could be in hiding. Robb believes they're alive. And he must go on believing. He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail. And you must remain strong for him.

Martyn : You're Robb Stark's wife.

Talisa : Hold still.

Martyn : Is it true what they say about him?

Talisa : I don't know. What do they say about him?

Martyn : That he can turn into a wolf at night.

Talisa : True.

Martyn : And he eats the flesh of his enemies.

Talisa : True. You're a Lannister, aren't you?

Martyn : Martyn Lannister.

Talisa : Martyn Lannister. You've nothing to fear. My husband doesn't eat children. Unless it's a full moon. It's not a full moon tonight, is it? See? Nothing to fear.

Mance : Always the artists.

Jon Snow : It's only horses. No men.

Ygritte : You said there was dead crows.

Orell : There was.

Mance : How many men were here?

Jon Snow : About three hundred.

Mance : And you know what those men are now?

Mance : We're all the same to them - meat for their army.

Jon Snow : Do you think anyone got away?

Mance : It's not impossible. You don't go far betting against Mormont. But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north. And he lost. His best fighting men are dead. And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home. Tormund. Climb the Wall. Take Orell and twenty good men. And take this one. He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us. And if he's useful, good. If not throw him off the Wall. See if crows can fly.

Tormund : We're finally going to war, old friend?

Mance : Hide near Castle Black. When I give the signal, hit them in the night. They've got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side.

Tormund : We'll meet again.

Mance : Aye. If you do your job. Ah.

Orell : How will we see your signal?

Mance : Send your eagle above the Wall every night. When it's time, I'm going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen.

Sam : Ghost?

Craster : What have we here? Frozen crows?

Jeor : We've come a long way.

Craster : Smaller flock than you went north with.

Jeor : We can talk inside.

Craster : Oh, can we?

Woman : They need some water.

Woman : Tether it and I'll be inside.

Craster : Keep your eyes where they belong. They're not for you.

Karl Tanner : Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.

Craster : Aye, pig's got value to me. You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in. I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man.

Jeor : You are a godly man?

Craster : I am. I got no fear of what's out there. When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you. The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods. The real gods.

Craster : Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist. Women. That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight. Barely a grunt. And she's almost as fat as this one here. Now why don't you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go. Well, look at him. He's a walking feast.

Woman : Here we are.

Woman : Sharpen these for me, would ya?

Woman : I see the head. Push.

Woman : That's it. You're nearly there. One more push should do it.

Gilly : What is it? What is it?

Ramsay Bolton : Keep quiet.

Ramsay Bolton : If you can't ride, we don't stand a chance.

Theon Greyjoy : I can ride.

Ramsay Bolton : You're sure?

Ramsay Bolton : Ride east. Follow the rising sun. Your sister's waiting for you.

Theon Greyjoy : I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.

Ramsay Bolton : We're not in the Iron Islands. Go.

Theon Greyjoy : Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

Man : Come on back.

Stannis Baratheon : You refuse to tell me where you're going?

Melisandre : I don't know yet. The fires will show me.

Stannis Baratheon : How long will you be gone?

Melisandre : I don't know.

Stannis Baratheon : You're abandoning me.

Melisandre : I will never abandon you. You are the Son of Fire. I am sworn to serve you.

Stannis Baratheon : Then serve me.

Melisandre : When I return, you will understand.

Stannis Baratheon : My enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son.

Melisandre : I cannot.

Stannis Baratheon : Why?

Melisandre : You don't have the strength. It would kill you.

Stannis Baratheon : I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years.

Stannis Baratheon : I want you.

Melisandre : Your fires burn low, my king.

Melisandre : There is another way. A better way.

Stannis Baratheon : You told me your magic requires a king's blood.

Melisandre : Yes.

Stannis Baratheon : I'm the one true king.

Melisandre : You are. But there are others with your blood in their veins. You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices. The Lord of Light demands it.

Barristan : The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : To whom?

Barristan : To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did.

Daenerys Targaryen : Give me your water.

Jorah Mormont : Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death.

Daenerys Targaryen : Here, drink.

Barristan : Leave this place, Your Grace. Leave tonight, I beg you.

Jorah Mormont : And what is she to do for soldiers?

Barristan : We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.

Jorah Mormont : Is it 'we' already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it. That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done.

Daenerys Targaryen : The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents.

Jorah Mormont : How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?

Barristan : Three.

Jorah Mormont : Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands?

Jorah Mormont : I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead.

Daenerys Targaryen : Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?

Barristan : When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction. I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace. I bled beside him.

Jorah Mormont : Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died.

Daenerys Targaryen : Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?

Barristan : I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met.

Daenerys Targaryen : I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon.

Missandei : All? Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?

Daenerys Targaryen : They did not. I want to buy them all.

Missandei : She wants to buy them all.

Kraznys : She can't afford them. The slut thinks that she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants.

Missandei : There are eight thousand Unsullied in Astapor. Is this what you mean by all?

Daenerys Targaryen : Yes. eight thousand. And the ones still in training as well.

Greizhen : If they fail on the battlefield, they will shame Astapor.

Missandei : Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys. If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.

Daenerys Targaryen : I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.

Kraznys : The slut cannot pay for all of this.

Missandei : Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.

Kraznys : Her ship will buy her a hundred Unsullied, no more.

Missandei : Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous.

Kraznys : And this is because I like the curve of her ass.

Missandei : The gold you have left is worth ten.

Kraznys : What is left will buy her ten. I will give her twenty if it stops her ignorant whimpering.

Missandei : But good Master Kraznys will give you twenty.

Kraznys : Her Dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed.

Missandei : The Dothraki you have with you-

Kraznys : I will give her three for those.

Missandei : The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them.

Kraznys : So, ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7,877?

Missandei : Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 unsullied.

Daenerys Targaryen : I have dragons. I'll give you one.

Barristan : You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.

Jorah Mormont : Khaleesi, please.

Kraznys : Three dragons.

Daenerys Targaryen : One.

Kraznys : Two.

Missandei : They want the biggest one.

Daenerys Targaryen : Done.

Kraznys : Done.

Daenerys Targaryen : I'll take you as well, now. You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me. A token of a bargain well struck.

Missandei : She asks that you give me to her, as a present. She asks that you do this now.

Jorah Mormont : Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army.

Barristan : Aegon Targaryen proved that.

Daenerys Targaryen : You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood?

Daenerys Targaryen : Do you have a name?

Missandei : This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice?

Missandei : No, Your Grace. No family living.

Daenerys Targaryen : You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth.

Missandei : Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense. Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less.

Daenerys Targaryen : I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.'

Missandei : There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?

Missandei : All questions have been taken from them. They obey, that is all. Once they are yours, they are yours. They will fall on their swords if you command it.

Daenerys Targaryen : And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed.

Missandei : Valar morghulis.

Daenerys Targaryen : Yes, all men must die. But we are not men.

Tyrion Lannister : A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.

Petyr Baelish : I'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city.

Tyrion Lannister : Not for bastards.

Ros : That's all of them, my lord.

Petyr Baelish : Thank you, my dear.

Tyrion Lannister : Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment.

Podrick : Yes, my lord.

Petyr Baelish : I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.

Tyrion Lannister : Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid.

Petyr Baelish : You should have him knighted.

Tyrion Lannister : If only the Master of Coin had such power.

Petyr Baelish : If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding.

Petyr Baelish : Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship.

Tyrion Lannister : We don't. I did fuck her once.

Petyr Baelish : I know.

Tyrion Lannister : But we don't.

Petyr Baelish : I know. But how would the queen get that idea?

Tyrion Lannister : Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?

Petyr Baelish : Keep a low profile.

Tyrion Lannister : If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are.

Petyr Baelish : Well, you are richer than I am.

Tyrion Lannister : Good point.

Petyr Baelish : They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores.

Tyrion Lannister : I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie.

Bronn : Come on, I'm here later. Come on.

Bronn : Tonight, then. Looks like dull reading.

Tyrion Lannister : You think all reading is dull reading.

Bronn : It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.

Tyrion Lannister : The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.

Bronn : Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.

Tyrion Lannister : Unless he made it all up, yes. Podrick, do keep up.

Tyrion Lannister : Podrick.

Podrick : Yes, my lord?

Tyrion Lannister : After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?

Podrick : No, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers.

Bronn : She's not bad with second-timers, either.

Podrick : Uh, my lord

Tyrion Lannister : A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?

Tyrion Lannister : Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me.

Marei : He's handsome. You didn't tell me he was handsome.

Tyrion Lannister : Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.

Podrick : My lord, I don't even

Tyrion Lannister : She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Be back in time for my supper.

Bronn : Pace yourself, lad.

Tyrion Lannister : For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold.

Bronn : Let me guess. He's not a magician.

Tyrion Lannister : No.

Bronn : He's stealing it?

Tyrion Lannister : Worse, he's borrowing it.

Bronn : What's wrong with that?

Tyrion Lannister : We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father.

Bronn : Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt.

Tyrion Lannister : Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive.

Bronn : I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest.

Bronn : And what if I don't?

Tyrion Lannister : Well, you have to.

Bronn : But what if I don't?

Tyrion Lannister : This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?

Bronn : The lado s practically skipping.

Tyrion Lannister : You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year.

Bronn : He's a squire. You don't pay him.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year.

Podrick : They wouldn't take it, my lord.

Bronn : Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.

Tyrion Lannister : Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.

Bronn : What did you tell them?

Podrick : I didn't tell them anything.

Tyrion Lannister : What did you do to them?

Podrick : Lots of things.

Tyrion Lannister : And they seemed to like these things?

Bronn : Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it.

Tyrion Lannister : Only they weren't paid.

Bronn : What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?

Tyrion Lannister : Is that what you're telling us?

Podrick : doesn't deny it.>/i>

Tyrion Lannister : Sit down, Podrick.

Tyrion Lannister : We're going to need details. Copious details.

Theon Greyjoy : Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on.

Soldier : Ha! Ha!

Soldier : You know how we deal with runaways here, do you?

Soldier : Take off his pants.

Theon Greyjoy : No! No! No, no, no!

Soldier : I'm gonna fuck you into the dirt.

Theon Greyjoy : No, please! No, no, no! No, don't!

Theon Greyjoy : No, please! No! No!

Soldier : You little bastard.

Ramsay Bolton : Come, my lord.

Ramsay Bolton : You're a long way from home and winter is coming.

Locke : I'll take the big bitch first. When she's good and wet, you lot can finish her off.

Brienne : My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth. Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing.

Locke : Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt. Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive. Nobody said shit about you.

Man : You're only making it worse.

Locke : Take her over there where it's dark. I'd like a little privacy.

Man : Come on!

Jaime Lannister : You know who she is, don't you?

Locke : A big dumb bitch from who cares where. Never been with a woman that big.

Jaime Lannister : She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?

Man : I'm gonna cut your throat!

Jaime Lannister : They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones.

Locke : I know what they are.

Jaime Lannister : Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched.

Locke : Bring her back here.

Man : Yes, my lord. Get up.

Man : Come on.

Man : Come on, on your feet.

Locke : Unbesmirched.

Jaime Lannister : Not defiled.

Locke : Fancy word for a fancy man.

Jaime Lannister : I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse. Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers. I learned a lot of fancy words.

Locke : I bet you did.

Locke : Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?

Jaime Lannister : You'll be a rich man till the end of your days. And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them. Lands, titles- you'll have them all. The North can't win this war. You're a smart man. You understand that. We have the numbers. We have the gold.

Locke : Aye, you have both.

Jaime Lannister : Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.

Locke : Hard to argue with that.

Jaime Lannister : Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I'm not as young and resilient as I was once.

Locke : None of us are. Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.

Man : Come on, men.

Locke : Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.

Jaime Lannister : I'm famished, actually.

Locke : I think we've got a spare partridge on the fire.

Jaime Lannister : Well, I do like partridge.

Locke : Bring the bird over here and the carving knife. Will this work as a table, my lord?

Jaime Lannister : Oh, yes. Yes, this will do nic- ah!

Locke : On the stump.

Locke : You think you're the smartest man there is. That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.

Jaime Lannister : My father-

Locke : And if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say 'my father' and that's it, all your troubles are gone.

Jaime Lannister : Don't.

Locke : Have you got something to say?

Locke : Careful. You don't want to say the wrong thing. You're nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain't here. Never forget that.

Locke : Here, this should help you remember.

End : CREDITS

Man : How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?

Locke : Depends if he's had any practice. Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for, Kingslayer? She loosened you up for us?

Brienne : He's going to fall. He's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him.

Jaime Lannister : Water. Water. Please, water. Wa-water. Water, please. Please. Please.

Jaime Lannister : If I die, you won't be getting-

Locke : Oh, enough. Here.

Locke : Can't say that I've ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.

Brienne : Stop!

Man : Far enough.

Locke : Do that again and I'll take your other hand.

Man : Come on, you.

Varys : Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in.

Tyrion Lannister : I hope we might speak. In confidence.

Varys : Oh, always in confidence.

Tyrion Lannister : About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?

Varys : Oh, no. It's a wonderful time.

Tyrion Lannister : I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-

Varys : End your life?

Tyrion Lannister : I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof.

Varys : Proof? Will there be a trial?

Tyrion Lannister : I need to know.

Varys : I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?

Tyrion Lannister : I don't know. Do I?

Varys : As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-

Varys : You do not possess at the moment.

Varys : But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special.

Tyrion Lannister : The sorcerer.

Varys : Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it.

Grenn : When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling.

Dolorous Edd : Or the shit.

Grenn : They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it.

Dolorous Edd : And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that.

Grenn : But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling.

Dolorous Edd : Oh, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day.

Rast : We need to get out of here.

Grenn : When the Lord Commander says we go, we go.

Rast : The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How'd that turn out for us?

Dolorous Edd : He had no way of knowing.

Rast : We do now. We know what's out there.

Grenn : Craster's been out here surviving.

Rast : So he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?

Dolorous Edd : We're like the sons he never had.

Rast : Mormont isn't gonna save you. This lummox here isn't gonna save you. When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves.

Gilly : Shh, shh, shh.

Gilly : You woke him.

Sam : I'm sorry. He's beautiful.

Gilly : Shh!

Sam : He's beautiful. Does he have a name?

Gilly : No.

Sam : Are you going to give him one?

Gilly : Why?

Gilly : Here.

Sam : Gilly.

Gilly : You said to hold it for you until you came back. You're back.

Sam : I wanted you to have it.

Gilly : I don't want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that? Can you?

Gilly : I don't have time for you. I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.

Jojen : You have to go after him.

Bran Stark : How?

Jojen : You know how.

Catelyn Stark : Brandon.

Bran Stark : Mother.

Catelyn Stark : How many times have I told you? No climbing.

Bran Stark : Mother, I need to find it. It's here. It's calling me.

Catelyn Stark : I want you to promise me. No more climbing.

Catelyn Stark : Promise me. Promise me! Promise me!

Bran Stark : Mother! Mother!

Catelyn Stark : Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me!

Varys : Is he very large?

Ros : No larger than usual, apparently. And yet they said that he was-

Varys : Extraordinary.

Ros : The most extraordinary man they've ever had. And they've had a lot of men.

Varys : We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?

Varys : What did he do to them?

Ros : I don't know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive.

Varys : So what did they say?

Ros : They said it was hard to describe.

Varys : Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?

Ros : He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.

Varys : Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?

Ros : He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest.

Varys : What makes you say so?

Ros : His shipboard inventory.

Varys : Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.

Ros : Former profession.

Varys : Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?

Ros : Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.

Varys : Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?

Ros : He's not interested in them, my lord.

Varys : How do you know?

Ros : Because I'm one of his girls.

Varys : Prodigies in odd places indeed.

Gendry Baratheon : What is this place?

Thoros : Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.

Sandor Clegane : You look like a bunch of swineherds.

Anguy : Some of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before.

Sandor Clegane : You're still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?

Beric : No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.

Sandor Clegane : Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.

Beric : And I won't see them again.

Sandor Clegane : Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren't fighting in a war. You're running from it.

Beric : Last I heard, you were King Joffrey's guard dog. But here you are a thousand miles from home. Which of us is running?

Sandor Clegane : Untie these ropes and we'll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?

Beric : Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.

Sandor Clegane : Ned Stark is dead. King Robert is dead. My brother's alive.

Sandor Clegane : You're fighting for ghosts.

Beric : That's what we are- ghosts waiting for you in the dark. You can't see us, but we see you. No matter whose cloak you wear- Lannister, Stark, Baratheon- you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down.

Sandor Clegane : You found god? Is that it?

Beric : Aye. I've been reborn in the light of the one true god. As have we all. As would any man who's seen the things we've seen.

Sandor Clegane : If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it.

Thoros : You'll die soon enough, dog. But it won't be murder, only justice.

Anguy : And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions you call yourselves. At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched.

Sandor Clegane : I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door.

Thoros : House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.

Sandor Clegane : Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?

Anguy : Murder is a crime.

Sandor Clegane : I never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not.

Arya Stark : You murdered Mycah. The butchers boy. My friend. He was twelve years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.

Sandor Clegane : Aye, he was a bleeder.

Beric : You don't deny killing this boy?

Sandor Clegane : I was Joffrey's sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince.

Arya Stark : That's a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.

Sandor Clegane : Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes.

Beric : You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat.

Sandor Clegane : So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here?

Beric : Aye. She might be. But it's me you'll fight.

Missandei : The master says they are untested. He says you would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price.

Missandei : And who knows? In ten years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus all shall prosper.

Daenerys Targaryen : Is it done, then? They belong to me?

Kraznys : It is done.

Missandei : It is done.

Kraznys : She holds the whip.

Missandei : You hold the whip.

Kraznys : The bitch has her army.

Daenerys Targaryen : Unsullied!

Daenerys Targaryen : Forward march!

Daenerys Targaryen : Halt!

Kraznys : Tell the bitch her beast won't come.

Daenerys Targaryen : A dragon is not a slave.

Kraznys : You speak Valyrian?

Daenerys Targaryen : I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue.

Daenerys Targaryen : Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child. Strike the chains off every slave you see!

Kraznys : I am your master.

Kraznys : Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

Daenerys Targaryen : Dracarys.

Daenerys Targaryen : Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men?

Thoros : Lord, cast your light upon us.

Men : Lord of Light, defend us.

Thoros : Show us the truth. Strike this man down if he is guilty. Give strength to his sword if he is true. Lord of Light, give us wisdom. For the night is dark and full of terrors.

Men : For the night is dark and full of terrors.

Thoros : Get back.

Men : Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

Arya Stark : Kill him!

Thoros : Lord, cast your light upon this man, your servant. Bring him back from death and darkness. His flame has been extinguished. Restore it.

Thoros : For the night is dark and full of terrors. Lord, cast-

Gendry Baratheon : Arya, don't!

Thoros : Bring him back from death and darkness

Arya Stark : No! Let go of me! Let me go!

Sandor Clegane : Looks like their god likes me more than your butcher's boy.

Arya Stark : Burn in hell!

Beric : He will. But not today.

Tormund : Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall. Tell me what you know.

Jon Snow : There are four to a patrol- two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies.

Orell : How often do these patrols go out?

Jon Snow : It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you.

Orell : You'd like to know that.

Tormund : There are nineteen castles guarding the Wall. How many are manned?

Jon Snow : Three.

Orell : You sure of that?

Orell : Which three?

Jon Snow : Castle Black.

Orell : Aye, Castle Black. Everyone knows Castle Black. Which others?

Jon Snow : Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.

Tormund : How many men remain in Castle Black?

Jon Snow : A thousand.

Orell : Liar.

Jon Snow : What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground?

Ygritte : He's no crow.

Orell : Just 'cause you want him inside you don't make him one of us.

Ygritte : I'm not afraid of you.

Tormund : I like you, boy. But if you lie to me, I'll pull your guts out through your throat.

Jon Snow : A thousand men.

Tormund : We'll find out soon enough.

Jon Snow : I don't need you to protect me.

Ygritte : Of course you do. Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt.

Jon Snow : Give it back.

Ygritte : Well, I stole it. It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back.

Jon Snow : Ygritte! Ygritte!

Jon Snow : Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte!

Ygritte : Is Orell right? Are you still a crow? It's time you proved yourself.

Jon Snow : Ygritte.

Ygritte : You swore some vows. I want you to break 'em. I want you to see me.

Ygritte : All of me.

Jon Snow : We shouldn't.

Ygritte : We should.

Ygritte : Why are you still dressed? You know nothing, Jon Sno-

Ygritte : That thing you did with your mouth- is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?

Jon Snow : I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.

Ygritte : Hmm.

Jon Snow : You seemed to like it.

Ygritte : Aye, I liked it some. Who taught you that?

Jon Snow : There's been no one else. Only you.

Ygritte : A maid. You were a maid.

Jon Snow : I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?

Ygritte : What do you think?

Jon Snow : Who was he?

Ygritte : Just a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth.

Jon Snow : Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund-

Ygritte : I'm not done with you yet.

Ygritte : How long's it been since you had a bath?

Ygritte : Let's not go back. Let's stay here a while longer. I don't ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow. Not ever.

Sandor Clegane : I want my gold.

Thoros : It says it clearly right there on that note you'll be repaid in full when the war is over.

Sandor Clegane : Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.

Anguy : We're outlaws. Outlaws steal. You're lucky we didn't kill you.

Sandor Clegane : Come try it, archer. I'll shove those arrows up your ass.

Arya Stark : You can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty.

Beric : Not in the eyes of god.

Arya Stark : You can't!

Beric : Enough! The judgment isn't ours to make.

Beric : Go in peace, Sandor Clegane. The Lord of Light isn't done with you yet.

Man : Riders coming through!

Man : The Kingslayer.

Man : Down!

Locke : On your knees. Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer.

Roose Bolton : Pick him up, Locke.

Roose Bolton : You've lost a hand.

Locke : No, my lord, he has it here.

Roose Bolton : Take this away.

Locke : Send it to his father?

Roose Bolton : You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.

Roose Bolton : Cut her free. Apologies, my lady. You're under my protection now.

Brienne : Thank you, my lord.

Roose Bolton : Find suitable rooms for our guests. We'll speak later.

Jaime Lannister : Lord Bolton.

Jaime Lannister : Is there word from the capital?

Roose Bolton : You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed.

Roose Bolton : Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.

Jaime Lannister : Will I die?

Qyburn : No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.

Jaime Lannister : Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?

Qyburn : The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow.

Jaime Lannister : I don't need my right hand to kill you.

Qyburn : I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption - with boiling wine.

Jaime Lannister : Mmm.

Qyburn : With any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy.

Jaime Lannister : No milk of the poppy.

Qyburn : There will be pain.

Jaime Lannister : I'll scream.

Qyburn : Quite a bit of pain.

Jaime Lannister : I'll scream loudly.

Cersei Lannister : Lord Baelish.

Petyr Baelish : Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

Petyr Baelish : Of course, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.

Petyr Baelish : I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?

Cersei Lannister : My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.

Petyr Baelish : Myself, I often find them a hindrance.

Cersei Lannister : And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital.

Petyr Baelish : I shall do my best.

Cersei Lannister : Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?

Petyr Baelish : I assure you that it will.

Olenna Tyrell : Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern.

Podrick : Pardon, my lady.

Olenna Tyrell : No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?

Tyrion Lannister : Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters.

Olenna Tyrell : I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?

Tyrion Lannister : It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.

Olenna Tyrell : Naturally.

Tyrion Lannister : It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.

Olenna Tyrell : What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?

Tyrion Lannister : I understand that.

Olenna Tyrell : Good.

Tyrion Lannister : But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense.

Olenna Tyrell : And?

Tyrion Lannister : And we're at war, Lady Olenna.

Olenna Tyrell : Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, and maintaining supply lines-

Olenna Tyrell : I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them.

Tyrion Lannister : And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.

Olenna Tyrell : As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?

Tyrion Lannister : I would.

Olenna Tyrell : And traditionally paid for by the royal family.

Olenna Tyrell : I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?

Tyrion Lannister : My lady-

Olenna Tyrell : Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?

Tyrion Lannister : Quite sufficient. Thank you.

Olenna Tyrell : Very good, then. That's settled. Good day.

Tyrion Lannister : Give me that.

Arya Stark : What are you doing?

Gendry Baratheon : Just mending Lord Beric's armor.

Arya Stark : Why?

Gendry Baratheon : I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.

Arya Stark : Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet.

Gendry Baratheon : The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.

Arya Stark : You don't have to do this.

Gendry Baratheon : I want to. They need good men.

Arya Stark : Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you-

Gendry Baratheon : What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving.

Arya Stark : You just said you were serving Lord Beric.

Gendry Baratheon : He may be their leader, but they chose him. These men are brothers. They're a family. I've never had a family.

Arya Stark : I can be your family.

Gendry Baratheon : You wouldn't be my family. You'd be 'my lady'.

Martyn : Willem. Willem!

Willem : Is this a rescue?

Rickard Karstark : Lannister filth! Take him!

Martyn : Please, I didn't do anything. I'm just a squire. Please-

Robb Stark : Bring them in.

Robb Stark : Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?

Rickard Karstark : Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance.

Robb Stark : Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-

Rickard Karstark : Was strangled by the Kingslayer. They were his kin.

Robb Stark : They were boys! Look at them.

Rickard Karstark : Tell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I.

Robb Stark : My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.

Rickard Karstark : It's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy?

Robb Stark : Leave him.

Rickard Karstark : Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?

Robb Stark : Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.

Man : Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone. I only watched for the guards.

Robb Stark : This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die.

Man : Please! Please, no. They made me do it! They made me! They made me!

Edmure : Word of this can't leave Riverrun. They were Tywin Lannister's nephews. The Lannisters pay their debts. They never stop talking about it.

Robb Stark : Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?

Edmure : It wouldn't be lying. We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.

Robb Stark : I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die.

Catelyn Stark : The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord.

Talisa : Your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you.

Robb Stark : You tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead.

Talisa : And more boys will keep dying until this war is over. You need Karstark men to end it.

Catelyn Stark : Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.

Edmure : A hostage. Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed.

Rickard Karstark : The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy. I fought the Mad King for your father. I fought Joffrey for you. We are kin- Stark and Karstark.

Robb Stark : That didn't stop you from betraying me. And it won't save you now.

Rickard Karstark : I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.

Robb Stark : Kneel, my lord.

Robb Stark : Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word?

Rickard Karstark : Kill me and be cursed. You are no king of mine.

Arya Stark : Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me?

Thoros : At first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now. He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.

Arya Stark : I'm a hostage and you're selling me.

Thoros : Don't think of it that way.

Arya Stark : But it is that way.

Thoros : It is. And it isn't.

Arya Stark : More is than isn't.

Thoros : Beric admired your father a great deal, you know. He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.

Arya Stark : So why don't you?

Thoros : We need the gold.

Beric : Do I frighten you, child?

Arya Stark : No.

Beric : You're angry with me. And I don't blame you. But letting him go was the right thing. I have more reason than most to want him hanged.

Arya Stark : I thought he killed you.

Beric : He did.

Arya Stark : But how?

Beric : Thoros how many times have you brought me back?

Thoros : It's the Lord of Light brings you back. I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.

Beric : How many times?

Thoros : Five, I think. No, this makes six.

Beric : Six.

Thoros : There was the first time- the Mountain. Show her. Lance right through the chest.

Beric : Then I was stabbed in the belly.

Thoros : Then it was an arrow in the back. And that axe in the side.

Beric : Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?

Thoros : Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.

Thoros : And the Hound makes six.

Beric : Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.

Thoros : You'd think you'd learn. It's not getting any easier, you know.

Beric : I know. Every time I come back, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away.

Arya Stark : Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.

Thoros : I don't think it works that way, child.

Beric : He was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere. I would never wish my life upon him.

Arya Stark : I would. You're alive.

Selyse : Lord, cast your light upon me. Protect me in the darkness. Burn away my sins. Help me serve you. Use me as you will. For the night is dark and full of terrors.

Selyse : I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.

Stannis Baratheon : My lady.

Stannis Baratheon : I meant to come sooner. The battle-

Selyse : I know of your troubles, My king. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.

Stannis Baratheon : Yes, of course.

Selyse : You mustn't despair. Your claim is true. You will be victorious.

Stannis Baratheon : I believed that once.

Selyse : You are the one godo s champion and the finest man I've ever known.

Stannis Baratheon : Selyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned.

Selyse : No.

Stannis Baratheon : I've wronged you. I have shamed you.

Selyse : You're doing godo s work.

Stannis Baratheon : You don't understand. The Red Woman- the Lady Melisandre-

Selyse : I know, Stannis. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin. When she told me, I wept with joy.

Selyse : Oh, my sweet boys. Petyr, Tommard, Edric. I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us. She gave you a son. I gave you - nothing.

Stannis Baratheon : That's not true.

Selyse : So you've come to see her as well? There is no need. You must keep away from such distractions.

Stannis Baratheon : She's my daughter. I want to see her.

Selyse : You are a king. You don't need my permission.

Shireen : Under the sea I know, I know/ Oh, oh, oh

Shireen : The birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know, I know / Oh, oh, oh

Stannis Baratheon : Shireen.

Shireen : Father!

Stannis Baratheon : You've grown since I last saw you.

Shireen : Mother said you fought in a battle. Did you win?

Stannis Baratheon : No.

Shireen : Did the Onion Knight come back with you?

Stannis Baratheon : He did. He fought bravely.

Shireen : He hasn't come to visit me. He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.

Stannis Baratheon : He won't be visiting, child.

Shireen : Why not? He's my friend. Look.

Shireen : He made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.

Stannis Baratheon : Ser Davos is a traitor. He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime. Best forget him.

Jaime Lannister : Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.

Brienne : What are you doing here?

Jaime Lannister : I need a bath. Help me out of these rags.

Jaime Lannister : Now get out.

Brienne : There's another tub.

Jaime Lannister : This one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.

Brienne : Why should I care how you die?

Jaime Lannister : You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.

Jaime Lannister : That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-

Brienne : Don't you mock me.

Jaime Lannister : I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.

Brienne : You need trust to have a truce.

Jaime Lannister : I trust you.

Jaime Lannister : There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?

Brienne : Of course.

Jaime Lannister : The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?

Jaime Lannister : First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me.

Brienne : If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?

Jaime Lannister : Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?

Brienne : Help! Help! The Kingslayer!

Jaime Lannister : Jaime. My name is Jaime.

Shireen : Onion Knight. Ser Onion Knight.

Davos : Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?

Shireen : Shh, you'll wake Bert.

Davos : Bert?

Shireen : He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight. He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.

Davos : Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here. If your father knew-

Shireen : he said you Were a traitor. Are you?

Davos : I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price.

Shireen : I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle.

Davos : Aye. So they did.

Shireen : You can hide the book under your cloak. It's a good one. I'll bring you more.

Davos : Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me.

Shireen : Take it. I have more.

Davos : My lady, I can't read the words.

Shireen : You can't?

Shireen : I'll teach you. I'll come when Bert's on duty and teach you.

Davos : No. No. No.

Shireen : It's easy. It'll be fun.

Davos : Go. We can't.

Shireen : Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?

Davos : I wouldn't know where to start.

Shireen : At the beginning. This word is Aegon. When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg. And the title of the whole book is 'An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.'

Jorah Mormont : It was a bitch of a siege.

Barristan : Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?

Jorah Mormont : The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his.

Barristan : Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman. Robert knighted you after the battle?

Jorah Mormont : Proudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. 'In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.' All I could think of was how badly I had to piss.

Jorah Mormont : In full plate metal for sixteen hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.

Barristan : Robert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings.

Jorah Mormont : You swore an oath.

Barristan : Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her?

Jorah Mormont : With all my heart.

Daenerys Targaryen : These are the ones?

Missandei : Yes, khaleesi. The officers.

Daenerys Targaryen : You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?

Daenerys Targaryen : Remove your helmet

Grey Worm : This one has the honor.

Daenerys Targaryen : What is your name?

Grey Worm : Grey Worm.

Daenerys Targaryen : Grey Worm.

Missandei : All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut- Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat. Names that remind them what they are- vermin.

Daenerys Targaryen : From this day forward you will choose your own names. You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same. Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride.

Grey Worm : Grey Worm" gives me pride. It is a very lucky name. The name this one was born with was cursed. That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free.

Jorah Mormont : King Robert wanted her dead.

Barristan : Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.

Jorah Mormont : I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.

Barristan : I didn't sit on the small council.

Jorah Mormont : No? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-

Barristan : Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion.

Barristan : He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics.

Jorah Mormont : Yeah, I imagine I would, too. Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over.

Barristan : Mm-hmm.

Jorah Mormont : Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.

Barristan : She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience.

Jorah Mormont : Which men do you have in mind?

Barristan : Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years.

Jorah Mormont : It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.

Barristan : I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.

Jorah Mormont : Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man.

Barristan : We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?

Jorah Mormont : You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.

Barristan : If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride.

Jorah Mormont : You're not Lord here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen.

Talisa : Come to bed.

Robb Stark : You were right.

Robb Stark : The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.

Talisa : Don't let him.

Robb Stark : What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.

Talisa : We could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.

Robb Stark : Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children.

Talisa : Give them a new purpose.

Robb Stark : What?

Talisa : Oh, I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is.

Robb Stark : Here. And we're here. King's Landing-

Talisa : What is it?

Robb Stark : I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not.

Robb Stark : And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them.

Talisa : Can you do it?

Robb Stark : I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry- Walder Frey.

Sansa Stark : He's such a splendid fighter. Do you have any idea when we might

Margaery Tyrell : I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married. It should grow quickly.

Sansa Stark : Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here.

Margaery Tyrell : And only one to let you go. Because it will please me.

Loras : Squire!

Olyvar : Well fought, ser.

Loras : That was no fight. I don't know you.

Olyvar : Olyver, if it please you.

Olyvar : I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser.

Loras : How did you know?

Olyvar : Know what?

Loras : That I wanted to.

Loras : My lord, I'll have you know I'm to be married soon and even my intended hasn't the slightest notion.

Olyvar : They rarely do, in my experience.

Loras : You have a good deal of experience, do you?

Olyvar : With the husbands.

Petyr Baelish : That didn't take long.

Olyvar : Well, it took long enough. It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.

Petyr Baelish : Is he? And who's the lucky girl?

Petyr Baelish : She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. Strange, isn't it?

Sansa Stark : What is?

Petyr Baelish : It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different.

Sansa Stark : Is it?

Petyr Baelish : Lady Margaery wears it that way.

Sansa Stark : Many ladies wear it this way.

Petyr Baelish : I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.

Sansa Stark : You still want me to come with you?

Petyr Baelish : It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?

Sansa Stark : Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare.

Petyr Baelish : I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend.

Sansa Stark : I do, Lord Baelish.

Petyr Baelish : Petyr.

Sansa Stark : Petyr.

Petyr Baelish : If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay.

Petyr Baelish : We'll speak again when I return.

Tywin Lannister : You're late.

Tyrion Lannister : What's she doing here?

Tywin Lannister : Our business concerns her, too. Sit.

Tyrion Lannister : You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding.

Tywin Lannister : Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.

Tyrion Lannister : Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.

Tywin Lannister : Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

Tyrion Lannister : Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.

Tywin Lannister : Your jokes are not appreciated.

Tyrion Lannister : It wasn't my best, but-

Tywin Lannister : I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.

Tyrion Lannister : Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.

Tywin Lannister : The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.

Tyrion Lannister : The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?

Tywin Lannister : There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.

Tyrion Lannister : And how do we do that?

Tywin Lannister : We find Sansa Stark a different husband.

Tyrion Lannister : Wonderful.

Cersei Lannister : Yes, it is.

Tyrion Lannister : You can't mean it.

Tywin Lannister : I can and I do.

Tyrion Lannister : Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.

Tywin Lannister : Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours.

Tyrion Lannister : She's a child!

Cersei Lannister : She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length.

Tywin Lannister : There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that.

Tyrion Lannister : And if I refuse?

Tywin Lannister : You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.

Tyrion Lannister : I was wed. Or don't you remember?

Tywin Lannister : Only too well.

Cersei Lannister : You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.

Tywin Lannister : Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.

Cersei Lannister : What do you mean?

Tywin Lannister : You'll marry Ser Loras.

Cersei Lannister : I will not.

Tywin Lannister : The boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach.

Cersei Lannister : No, I won't do it.

Tywin Lannister : Yes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed.

Cersei Lannister : I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.

Tywin Lannister : You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.

Cersei Lannister : Father, don't make me do it again, please.

Tywin Lannister : Not another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.

Shireen : It's always summer / Under the sea / I know I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The birds have scales / And the fish take wing / I know I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The rain is dry / and snow falls up / I know, I know / Oh, oh, oh. / The stones crack open / The water burns / The shadows come to dance / My lord / The shadows come to play / The shadows come to dance / My lord / The shadows come to stay.

Gilly : You've got too much wood in there.

Sam : But the more wood, the bigger the fire.

Gilly : It needs to breathe. Take off that big log.

Sam : Huh. You know your fires.

Gilly : Someone built your fires for you growing up?

Sam : It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course.

Gilly : I knew you were highborn.

Sam : Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men. Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think.

Gilly : What does it do?

Sam : I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?

Gilly : How much longer?

Sam : Not so far. A few more days.

Gilly : Is the Wall as big as they say?

Sam : Bigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.

Gilly : You're playing with me.

Sam : I'm not. It's seven hundred feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping. Castle Black is nice enough. They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night. And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty. Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best.

Gilly : Do you sing?

Sam : No. No, no, no. Not very well.

Gilly : Sing me a song.

Sam : Oh, all right. Let's see.

Sam : Oh ahem. The father's face is stern and strong / He sits and judges right from wrong / He weighs our lives, the short and long / And loves the little children / The mother gives the gift of life / And watches over every wife / Her gentle smile ends all strife /And she loves her little children.

Osha : That's not how you skin a rabbit.

Meera : I know how to skin a rabbit.

Osha : Not by the looks of it.

Osha : You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game.

Meera : I didn't see any game before I got here.

Osha : If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen rabbits.

Meera : Well, I made this bow myself. Guess you don't learn how to do that north of the Wall.

Osha : You learn how to use your fists, though.

Meera : Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?

Osha : I had someone else in mind.

Meera : Well, someone else is sitting right here.

Bran Stark : You're both very good at skinning rabbits.

Osha : Some of us are just a little better.

Meera : Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them. Or don't they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?

Osha : You've got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth.

Bran Stark : Stop it!

Hodor : Hodor.

Bran Stark : You've been fighting since you met. Just stop it.

Osha : Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass, it's a wonder her feet touch the ground.

Bran Stark : You've been nasty to her every day. Of course she's nasty back.

Osha : Me? It's my fault? First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat.

Bran Stark : First time I met you, you held a knife at me. We can't fight each other. We'll never make it to the Wall. I want you both to make peace.

Meera : Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine.

Osha : I said so, didn't I?

Bran Stark : Osha!

Osha : You're a good little hunter.

Meera : Thank you. See? Not so hard, is it? Thank you.

Osha : Don't push me.

Meera : Shh. I'm right here with you.

Rickon : What's happening?

Meera : I'm right here with you.

Rickon : What's wrong with him?

Meera : The visions take their toll.

Bran Stark : He's having one now?

Jojen : I saw Jon Snow.

Bran Stark : You saw him? At Castle Black?

Jojen : He was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies.

Tormund : Used to be you couldn't find a tree within a mile of the Wall. Crows would come out every morning with axes.

Orell : Your flock gets smaller every year.

Jon Snow : You ever climbed it before?

Ygritte : No. But Tormundo s done it half a hundred times. You're afraid.

Jon Snow : Aren't you?

Ygritte : Aye. It's a long way up and a long way down. But I've waited my whole life to see the world from up there. Here, sit down.

Ygritte : I brought a pair for you. They're too big for you, but they're good.

Jon Snow : You kill someone for them?

Ygritte : Nah. I didn't kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised.

Ygritte : He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me. He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.

Jon Snow : Can we not talk about that here?

Ygritte : Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls.

Jon Snow : Did I seem scared the other day?

Ygritte : You were trembling like a leaf.

Jon Snow : Only in the beginning.

Ygritte : Only in the beginning. You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

Jon Snow : What secret?

Ygritte : Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.

Ygritte : But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down.

Ygritte : It's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me.

Jon Snow : I won't.

Ygritte : Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck.

Tormund : Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step. And if you fall, don't scream. You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers.

Arya Stark : Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne.

Anguy : You're good. You're not as good as you think you are.

Arya Stark : Face, tits, balls- I hit 'em right where I wanted to.

Anguy : Aye, but you took your sweet time of it. You won't be fighting straw men, little lady. Show me your position.

Anguy : Keep your elbow high. You want your back doing the hard labor. You're holding. Never hold.

Arya Stark : What?

Anguy : Your muscles tense up when you hold. Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release. Never hold.

Arya Stark : But I have to aim.

Anguy : Never aim.

Arya Stark : Never aim?

Anguy : Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go. Trust your eye.

Arya Stark : There's someone out there.

Anguy : That's about far enough.

Melisandre : We come as friends.

Anguy : Begging your pardon, m'lady, but we'll be the judge of that.

Melisandre : Valar morghulis.

Thoros : Valar dohaeris. I don't see many priestesses of R'hollor in the Riverlands.

Melisandre : You are Thoros of Myr.

Melisandre : The High Priest gave you a mission. Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light. What happened?

Thoros : I failed.

Melisandre : You quit, you mean. The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk.

Thoros : You worship Him in your way, and I'll worship Him in mine. Do you speak the common tongue?

Thoros : My friends here don't speak High Valyrian. Why are you here, my lady?

Beric : Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days.

Thoros : Lucky for the ladies.

Melisandre : How many times has the Lord brought him back?

Thoros : Six.

Melisandre : That's not possible.

Thoros : The Lord has smiled upon me.

Melisandre : You should not have this power.

Thoros : I have no power. I ask the Lord for His favor, and He responds as He will.

Thoros : I've always been a terrible priest. Drank too much rum. Fucked all the whores in King's Landing. It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him.

Melisandre : You've been to the other side.

Beric : The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason.

Melisandre : You have someone He needs.

Anguy : Bodkin point. Penetrates plate at two hundred yards. Can you make 'em?

Gendry Baratheon : Yeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel.

Anguy : I'll get you the steel.

Man : Come on.

Arya Stark : I don't like that woman.

Anguy : That's 'cause you're a girl.

Arya Stark : What does that have to do with anything?

Beric : Forgive me, lad.

Arya Stark : What are you doing? Let go of him.

Arya Stark : Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!

Beric : We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy.

Arya Stark : Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?

Arya Stark : You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.

Thoros : We're doing it for both, girl. We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food. And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold.

Gendry Baratheon : You told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you.

Melisandre : You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.

Arya Stark : You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.

Melisandre : I see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me- brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes you'll shut forever. We will meet again.

Ygritte : You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?

Tormund : Look out!

Ygritte : You all right?

Tormund : Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad.

Ramsay Bolton : Sorry. Were you sleeping?

Theon Greyjoy : Wa-

Ramsay Bolton : Wa-? Wa-? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you.

Ramsay Bolton : So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?

Theon Greyjoy : Please.

Ramsay Bolton : Please is not a body part.

Theon Greyjoy : I'll tell you everything, please.

Ramsay Bolton : But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you.

Ramsay Bolton : Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that.

Ramsay Bolton : You've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger.

Theon Greyjoy : If I win, you'll let me go?

Ramsay Bolton : If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.

Ramsay Bolton : You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?

Theon Greyjoy : The North.

Ramsay Bolton : Too vague.

Theon Greyjoy : Deepwood Motte.

Ramsay Bolton : Terrible guess.

Ramsay Bolton : Now, where?

Theon Greyjoy : Last Hearth.

Ramsay Bolton : Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?

Theon Greyjoy : Karhold!

Ramsay Bolton : Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?

Theon Greyjoy : No. It was just a guess.

Ramsay Bolton : Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?

Theon Greyjoy : Torrhen Karstark.

Ramsay Bolton : He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer.

Theon Greyjoy : He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.

Theon Greyjoy : You swore to tell me if I-

Ramsay Bolton : You're right.

Theon Greyjoy : Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.

Ramsay Bolton : Yes. You win.

Ramsay Bolton : Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar.

Ramsay Bolton : I'm afraid I am.

Ramsay Bolton : Everything I told you is a lie.

Ramsay Bolton : This isn't happening to you for a reason. Well, one reason- I enjoy it.

Theon Greyjoy : Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!

Ramsay Bolton : I win.

Robb Stark : Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.

Black Walder : The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits. But when the King of the North summons us, we come.

Lothar : Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.

Robb Stark : Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.

Black Walder : As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands.

Edmure : I don't think that's-

Robb Stark : We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.

Black Walder : And there's something else.

Robb Stark : We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.

Black Walder : Not what, whom.

Edmure : What?

Edmure : No.

Lothar : Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters- Roslin.

Edmure : How old is she?

Lothar : Nineteen.

Edmure : Could I see her first?

Black Walder : You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.

Brynden : Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?

Lothar : Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.

Black Walder : And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.

Robb Stark : He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.

Edmure : Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord.

Robb Stark : He's a proud man and we've wounded him.

Edmure : I didn't wound him. My answer is no.

Brynden : Listen to me and listen very carefully. You-

Edmure : The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry.

Brynden : The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.

Robb Stark : It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead.

Edmure : He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing.

Catelyn Stark : You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?

Robb Stark : I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.

Brynden : You recall that heroic engagement?

Edmure : I had something less permanent in mind.

Robb Stark : I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost.

Edmure : I'll marry her.

Robb Stark : You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it.

Roose Bolton : I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.

Brienne : Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing.

Roose Bolton : When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason.

Roose Bolton : I should send you back to Robb Stark.

Jaime Lannister : You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?

Roose Bolton : Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.

Jaime Lannister : We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.

Roose Bolton : You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.

Jaime Lannister : It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.

Roose Bolton : King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.

Jaime Lannister : He'll make time for you.

Roose Bolton : As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming.

Jaime Lannister : Shall we drink on it?

Roose Bolton : I don't partake.

Jaime Lannister : You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?

Jaime Lannister : Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident.

Roose Bolton : Oh, she won't be going with you.

Brienne : I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-

Roose Bolton : You are charged with abetting treason.

Jaime Lannister : I'm afraid I must insist.

Roose Bolton : You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.

Olenna Tyrell : Impossible.

Tywin Lannister : Why?

Olenna Tyrell : My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-

Tywin Lannister : Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king.

Olenna Tyrell : Old.

Tywin Lannister : Old?

Olenna Tyrell : Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely.

Tywin Lannister : The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?

Olenna Tyrell : Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through.

Tywin Lannister : And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.

Olenna Tyrell : Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?

Tywin Lannister : Of course.

Olenna Tyrell : And you never-

Tywin Lannister : No.

Olenna Tyrell : Not once? Not in any way?

Tywin Lannister : Never.

Olenna Tyrell : I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets.

Tywin Lannister : Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.

Olenna Tyrell : I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out.

Tywin Lannister : I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.

Olenna Tyrell : Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation.

Tywin Lannister : I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.

Olenna Tyrell : As an authority on myself, I must disagree.

Tywin Lannister : Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.

Olenna Tyrell : And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take.

Tywin Lannister : The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.

Tywin Lannister : If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children.

Olenna Tyrell : Oh

Tywin Lannister : The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.

Olenna Tyrell : You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?

Tywin Lannister : I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?

Olenna Tyrell : It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.

Orell : No!

Orell : We've gotta cut them loose!

Tormund : No!

Jon Snow : Take my hand!

Sansa Stark : That's a wonderful pin.

Loras : Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so

Sansa Stark : I'm very happy about

Loras : Uh, yes. I-I am as well.

Sansa Stark : I feel like I'm in a dream.

Loras : Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?

Sansa Stark : No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.

Loras : It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.

Cersei Lannister : We can have them both killed.

Tyrion Lannister : It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.

Cersei Lannister : Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.

Tyrion Lannister : On a boat you built.

Cersei Lannister : The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.

Cersei Lannister : I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.

Tyrion Lannister : Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?

Tyrion Lannister : The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot.

Cersei Lannister : What do you want me to say?

Tyrion Lannister : I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.

Cersei Lannister : Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.

Tyrion Lannister : Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.

Cersei Lannister : Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands.

Tyrion Lannister : You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels.

Cersei Lannister : When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere.

Tyrion Lannister : Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.

Cersei Lannister : Who's going to tell her?

Sansa Stark : Do you think people will like it?

Shae : I don't think they will even notice it.

Sansa Stark : You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade.

Shae : I'm sure he does.

Sansa Stark : Will they let me invite my family?

Shae : They haven't asked my opinion.

Sansa Stark : But do you think they will?

Shae : No.

Maid : Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you. Should I-

Tyrion Lannister : I beg your pardon, my lady.

Sansa Stark : Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.

Sansa Stark : Of course.

Tyrion Lannister : Alone, if I may.

Shae : Why do you need to speak to her alone?

Sansa Stark : Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to.

Tyrion Lannister : Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.

Sansa Stark : It's all right, really.

Tyrion Lannister : How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.

Varys : A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.

Petyr Baelish : There aren't. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.

Varys : Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice.

Petyr Baelish : Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want.

Varys : Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?

Petyr Baelish : You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.

Varys : I did what I did for the good of the realm.

Petyr Baelish : The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.

Varys : But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.

Petyr Baelish : Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.

Petyr Baelish : Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.

Petyr Baelish : And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.

Ygritte : How far are we?

Jon Snow : About a week, I think.

Ygritte : You think? You don't know?

Jon Snow : When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad.

Ygritte : You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?

Jon Snow : Most of the time, yes.

Ygritte : How do the men holding the banners fight?

Jon Snow : They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.

Ygritte : And the drummers- is that a great honor, too?

Jon Snow : Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.

Ygritte : So what good are they?

Jon Snow : They help the men march.

Ygritte : How?

Jon Snow : Well, it's- it's the rhythm.

Ygritte : Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming.

Jon Snow : No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming.

Ygritte : You know nothing, Jon Snow.

Orell : She's right, you don't.

Jon Snow : I know you cut me loose on the Wall.

Orell : Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are.

Jon Snow : And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?

Orell : People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her.

Brynden : That rain will cost us another day.

Robb Stark : Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.

Catelyn Stark : Lord Walder is prickly by nature.

Brynden : Prickly? That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.

Catelyn Stark : Yes, and that is why-

Brynden : I've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey. Apologies, Your Grace. Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen.

Talisa : I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die. I'm not afraid of wet shits.

Catelyn Stark : Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.

Edmure : He can take it as he likes. He's getting the wedding he wanted.

Catelyn Stark : He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted.

Robb Stark : Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.

Robb Stark : If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again.

Talisa : Attack. Attack.

Robb Stark : Who are you writing?

Talisa : My mother.

Robb Stark : Is that Valyrian?

Talisa : Gaaa.

Robb Stark : Gaaa? Say hello for me.

Talisa : Rytsas.

Robb Stark : Ritsas.

Talisa : That was close enough.

Robb Stark : Does she know her daughter's a queen?

Talisa : Not yet.

Robb Stark : That will be a surprise, I expect.

Talisa : Many surprises for her.

Robb Stark : How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?

Talisa : Will you come with me one day to Volantis? When all this is over?

Robb Stark : I will.

Talisa : I promise. I know she'd love to meet you. And her grandchild.

Robb Stark : What, now? Are you certain?

Talisa : Are you angry with me?

Robb Stark : Angry? You're my queen.

Talisa : And I have your little prince or princess inside me.

Robb Stark : Maybe one of each.

Talisa : Don't get greedy.

Talisa : Can you leave the war for one night?

Robb Stark : I love you. Do you hear me? I love you.

Tormund : Most men fuck like dogs.

Tormund : No grace, no skill. A few dozen thrusts and done. You need to be patient. Give her time. Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal. And then you go inside, but slowly. Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig. Come on! Hey, come on.

Orell : You think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle?

Ygritte : No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks.

Orell : I've seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls.

Ygritte : What, you're jealous?

Orell : Of course I'm jealous. You should be with one of your own.

Ygritte : And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.

Orell : You would if you were mine. I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild. I'd be good to you. You love him?

Orell : Cause he's pretty? Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy?

Ygritte : Don't touch me.

Orell : You won't love him so much when you find out what he really is.

Sansa Stark : Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital. See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark- all the candles burning in all those windows. I'm stupid. A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns.

Margaery Tyrell : Come on. Come walk with me.

Margaery Tyrell : I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room. I'd never seen anyone who looked so unhappy. I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother.

Margaery Tyrell : You would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.

Sansa Stark : How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.

Margaery Tyrell : Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?

Sansa Stark : No.

Margaery Tyrell : Has he been kind to you?

Sansa Stark : He's tried.

Margaery Tyrell : You don't want him, though.

Sansa Stark : He's a Lannister.

Margaery Tyrell : Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?

Sansa Stark : I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.

Margaery Tyrell : My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What?

Sansa Stark : My son with him. I'll have to- we'll have to-

Margaery Tyrell : If it's the pain you're worried about-

Sansa Stark : I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.

Margaery Tyrell : What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar.

Sansa Stark : He's a dwarf. And Loras- Loras.

Margaery Tyrell : Some women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced.

Sansa Stark : And that's a good thing?

Margaery Tyrell : It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice.

Sansa Stark : How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?

Margaery Tyrell : Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me.

Tyrion Lannister : She's a child.

Bronn : She's a foot taller than you.

Tyrion Lannister : A tall child.

Bronn : What's the youngest you've ever had?

Tyrion Lannister : Not that young.

Bronn : How much older?

Tyrion Lannister : Older.

Bronn : You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem.

Tyrion Lannister : Shae isn't going to like it.

Bronn : Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?

Tyrion Lannister : I should never have told you about that.

Bronn : You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own.

Tyrion Lannister : Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.

Bronn : You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.

Bronn : You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free.

Tywin Lannister : Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : Grandfather.

Tywin Lannister : You wanted to speak to me?

Joffrey Lannister : Yes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.

Tywin Lannister : You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them.

Joffrey Lannister : I've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention.

Tywin Lannister : Of course.

Joffrey Lannister : You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.

Tywin Lannister : I have, yes.

Joffrey Lannister : May I ask why?

Tywin Lannister : The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively.

Joffrey Lannister : So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?

Tywin Lannister : We could arrange to have you carried.

Joffrey Lannister : Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.

Tywin Lannister : Where did you hear about this?

Joffrey Lannister : Is it true?

Tywin Lannister : Apparently so.

Joffrey Lannister : Don't you think we ought to do something about it?

Tywin Lannister : When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple.

Joffrey Lannister : And the biggest was the size of a carriage.

Tywin Lannister : Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us.

Joffrey Lannister : But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?

Tywin Lannister : Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.

Joffrey Lannister : But I haven't been counseled.

Tywin Lannister : You are being counseled at this very moment.

Joffrey Lannister : I should be consulted about such things.

Tywin Lannister : From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace.

Jorah Mormont : Yunkai. The Yellow City.

Barristan : The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them.

Jorah Mormont : On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man.

Daenerys Targaryen : I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.

Jorah Mormont : We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne.

Daenerys Targaryen : How many slaves are there in Yunkai?

Jorah Mormont : Two hundred thousand if not more.

Daenerys Targaryen : Then we have Two hundred thousand reasons to take the city.

Daenerys Targaryen : Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor.

Missandei : Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house, master of men and speaker to savages, to offer terms of peace.

Missandei : Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.

Daenerys Targaryen : You may approach. Sit.

Missandei : Will the noble lord take refreshment?

Radzal Mo Eraz : Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.

Radzal Mo Eraz : If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people.

Radzal Mo Eraz : The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen.

Radzal Mo Eraz : There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.

Daenerys Targaryen : My ship?

Radzal Mo Eraz : Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require.

Daenerys Targaryen : And what do you ask in return?

Radzal Mo Eraz : All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.

Daenerys Targaryen : I have a gift for you as well. Your life.

Radzal Mo Eraz : My life?

Daenerys Targaryen : And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy.

Radzal Mo Eraz : You are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Those who survive, we shall enslave once more. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.

Radzal Mo Eraz : You swore me safe conduct.

Daenerys Targaryen : I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother.

Radzal Mo Eraz : Take the gold.

Daenerys Targaryen : My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out.

Barristan : The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend.

Daenerys Targaryen : And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?

Jorah Mormont : I don't know.

Daenerys Targaryen : Find out.

Shae : Chains?

Tyrion Lannister : Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.

Shae : Golden chains.

Tyrion Lannister : You could buy a ship with these.

Shae : Do I need a ship?

Tyrion Lannister : What?

Shae : Am I going somewhere?

Tyrion Lannister : Of course you're not going anywhere.

Shae : So, am I invited to your wedding?

Tyrion Lannister : I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.

Shae : No? She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.

Tyrion Lannister : That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire.

Shae : Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?

Tyrion Lannister : I don't have a choice. My father-

Shae : Does not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea.

Tyrion Lannister : What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.

Shae : And I'm Shae the funny whore.

Tyrion Lannister : My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.

Shae : While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored?

Tyrion Lannister : I swear to you it will not be like that.

Shae : No? What will it be like?

Tyrion Lannister : I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for.

Shae : Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?

Tyrion Lannister : Listen. Listen to me, my lady.

Shae : I'm not your lady.

Tyrion Lannister : You are. You'll always be my lady.

Shae : I'm your whore. And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing.

Gendry Baratheon : What happened?

Melisandre : Wildfire. I should have been here.

Gendry Baratheon : After all the running and fighting, here I am, back where I started.

Melisandre : Do you miss it?

Gendry Baratheon : King's Landing?

Melisandre : Your father's house.

Gendry Baratheon : Never had a father. Never wanted one.

Melisandre : Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting?

Gendry Baratheon : I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.

Melisandre : Mine was a slave. So was I. Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand and raised me up.

Gendry Baratheon : I was born in Flea Bottom.

Melisandre : Your blood is noble.

Gendry Baratheon : Are you saying my father, he was some lord or-

Melisandre : There. Your father's house.

Gendry Baratheon : I'm just a bastard.

Melisandre : The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood.

Beric : Come sit by the fire, child.

Thoros : Not talking, eh? That's a first.

Arya Stark : I don't talk to traitors.

Beric : I didn't like giving up the boy.

Arya Stark : But you did. You took the gold and you gave him up.

Beric : The Red God is the one true god. You've seen his power. When he commands, we obey.

Arya Stark : He's not my one true god.

Beric : No? Who's yours?

Arya Stark : Death.

Anguy : Spotted a Lannister raiding party.

Beric : How many?

Anguy : No more than twenty.

Beric : How far?

Anguy : Less than a day's ride south.

Thoros : What do you say, boys? Time for a lion hunt?

Men : Yeah!

Arya Stark : But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here.

Thoros : It will still be west of here two days from now.

Arya Stark : You swore.

Beric : To take you home, and I will. But we need to do this first.

Arya Stark : Why? So you can steal their gold?

Beric : I swear to you, this isn't-

Arya Stark : I don't care what you swear because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all.

Beric : One day you'll understand, but now-

Beric : Anguy, bring her back.

Man : Come back, girl!

Sandor Clegane : Kick all you like, wolf girl. Won't do you no good.

Brienne : I thought you were gone.

Jaime Lannister : Tomorrow.

Brienne : Have they told you what they plan to do with me?

Jaime Lannister : Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well. He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding. You're to remain here.

Brienne : With Locke?

Jaime Lannister : I owe you a debt.

Brienne : When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her. Now it's your promise. You gave your word. Keep it and consider the debt paid.

Jaime Lannister : I will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it.

Brienne : Good-bye, Ser Jaime.

Qyburn : Here. Let me.

Qyburn : It will take time.

Roose Bolton : Qyburn hopes your father will force the Citadel to give him back his chain.

Jaime Lannister : My father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand.

Roose Bolton : You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust?

Jaime Lannister : Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards.

Locke : Safe journey, Kingslayer. Nothing to say? I liked you better before. I don't remember chopping your balls off, too. And don't you worry about your friend. We'll take good care of her.

Myranda : Shh.

Violet : Gentle, my lord. Gentle.

Violet : Shh, shh, shh. Myranda knows what she's doing. Let her. She trained as a septa, only she had other urges.

Myranda : So did the septons, only they lied about it.

Theon Greyjoy : Where is he?

Violet : Who, my lord?

Myranda : There's no one here but you, me, and Violet.

Theon Greyjoy : Please.

Violet : Don't you want us to see it?

Myranda : Oh, come on. Let us see it. Everybody talks about it.

Theon Greyjoy : He sent you.

Myranda : Who sent us?

Violet : We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy.

Myranda : We heard so much about it.

Violet : Oh! There it is.

Violet : Oh. Do you think we're ugly? He thinks we're ugly.

Myranda : Well, he's been through so much. Look at his poor face.

Theon Greyjoy : Help me. If he comes back-

Violet : We need to make him feel better.

Myranda : And how can we make him feel better?

Violet : I have an idea.

Violet : Oh, she's shy. You know how they are, these religious girls.

Myranda : Maybe he doesn't know how we are.

Myranda : Oh. I felt something. Oh, Lord Greyjoy.

Violet : As good as they say?

Myranda : Mmm.

Violet : And why should you get all the fun?

Myranda : What? You like her better?

Violet : Plenty there for both of us.

Myranda : I was here first.

Ramsay Bolton : I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Terrible timing.

Ramsay Bolton : But I was getting jealous.

Ramsay Bolton : Well? Should we see this cock everyone's always going on about?

Ramsay Bolton : Everyone knows you love girls. I bet you always thought they loved you back.

Ramsay Bolton : Your famous cock must be very precious to you. Would you say it's your most precious part?

Theon Greyjoy : Please. No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!

Ramsay Bolton : This is mercy. I'm not killing you. Just making a few alterations.

Theon Greyjoy : No! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please!

Jon Snow : You're gonna scare it off.

Ygritte : I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.

Jon Snow : It's too far away.

Ygritte : Is that a palace?

Jon Snow : It's a windmill.

Ygritte : Windmill. Who built it? Some king?

Jon Snow : Just the men who used to live here.

Ygritte : They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high.

Jon Snow : Winterfell has towers three times that size.

Ygritte : I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.

Jon Snow : If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell.

Ygritte : What's swooning?

Jon Snow : Fainting.

Ygritte : What's fainting?

Jon Snow : When a girl sees blood and collapses.

Ygritte : Why would a girl see blood and collapse?

Jon Snow : Well not all girls are like you.

Ygritte : Well, girls see more blood than boys. Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow? Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon Snow.

Ygritte : My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.

Jon Snow : I'd like to see you in a silk dress.

Ygritte : Would you?

Jon Snow : So I could tear it off you.

Ygritte : Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye.

Jon Snow : Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.

Ygritte : Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.

Jon Snow : Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that.

Ygritte : You know nothing-

Jon Snow : Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed.

Ygritte : And how do you know that?

Jon Snow : Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same.

Ygritte : Mance is different.

Jon Snow : You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.

Ygritte : You don't know that.

Jon Snow : I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you.

Ygritte : All of us.

Ygritte : You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live.

Jon Snow : Yes, first we'll live.

Osha : What's he going on about? And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work?

Hodor : Hodor.

Jojen : That's where we are.

Osha : What are you telling him?

Bran Stark : It's all right, Osha.

Osha : It's not all right. You think I can't hear you every day? Filling his head with black magic. Talking about visions and three-eyed ravens and worse.

Meera : Leave him alone.

Osha : He can speak for himself.

Jojen : I don't fill his head with anything.

Osha : So what do you talk about?

Jojen : What's happening to him and what that means.

Osha : Go on, then. Tell us what it means.

Jojen : It's not like that. I wish I could tell him all the answers. It would be much easier.

Osha : I don't want you talking to him anymore. Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.

Jojen : We're not going to Castle Black.

Osha : What did you say?

Jojen : I told you already. Jon Snow isn't there. Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.

Osha : Oh, no. I'm not going back there. Your brother is at Castle Black. That's where we're going. Look at me.

Bran Stark : The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now.

Osha : You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.

Bran Stark : What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?

Osha : Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone.

Bran Stark : You don't understand. You don't know.

Osha : You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long.

Osha : I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.

Qyburn : How is the pain, my lord?

Jaime Lannister : What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?

Qyburn : Well, we've stymied the corruption.

Jaime Lannister : Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man.

Qyburn : All the good it's done me.

Jaime Lannister : You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.

Qyburn : Faint praise, my lord.

Jaime Lannister : So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?

Qyburn : No, my lord. That's not my weakness.

Jaime Lannister : What is?

Qyburn : Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.

Jaime Lannister : You performed experiments on living men.

Qyburn : On dying men.

Jaime Lannister : With their permission?

Qyburn : My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.

Jaime Lannister : Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside.

Qyburn : How many men have you killed, my lord?

Jaime Lannister : I don't know.

Qyburn : Fifty? A hundred?

Qyburn : Countless.

Jaime Lannister : Countless has a nice ring to it.

Qyburn : And how many lives have you saved?

Jaime Lannister : Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?

Qyburn : A bird flew off and a bird flew back. Lord Selwyn Tarth offered three hundred gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.

Jaime Lannister : A fair offer.

Qyburn : A fair offer. Locke won't take it.

Jaime Lannister : Why not?

Qyburn : He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.

Qyburn : He feels he's being cheated.

Jaime Lannister : They'd be fools to kill her.

Qyburn : These men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much.

Jaime Lannister : We have to return to Harrenhal.

Steelshanks Walton : Why?

Jaime Lannister : I've left something behind.

Steelshanks Walton : Absolutely not. I've got orders from Lord Bolton.

Jaime Lannister : And what are those orders?

Steelshanks Walton : To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.

Jaime Lannister : You think you'll get a reward.

Steelshanks Walton : I serve Lord Bolton. Any appreciation your father-

Jaime Lannister : You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off.

Steelshanks Walton : I had nothing-

Jaime Lannister : Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.

Jaime Lannister : Whoa.

Steelshanks Walton : Eyes open, lads.

Jaime Lannister : Be quiet.

Men : The bear, the bear and the maiden fair / From there to here, from here to there / All black and brown and covered in hair / He smelled that girl in the summer air / The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair!

Man : Don't spare her. Don't spare her!

Locke : Well, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight.

Jaime Lannister : A wooden sword?

Locke : I thought you'd gone.

Jaime Lannister : You gave her a wooden sword.

Locke : We've only got one bear.

Jaime Lannister : I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there.

Locke : All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.

Locke : This makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it.

Brienne : Ah!

Jaime Lannister : Get behind me.

Brienne : I will not.

Locke : What the fuck are you doing to my bear?

Steelshanks Walton : Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do.

Jaime Lannister : Pull her up.

Brienne : Hold my legs.

Brienne : Pull him up!

Locke : The bitch stays.

Jaime Lannister : We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.

Locke : She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders.

Jaime Lannister : What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton? Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?

Jaime Lannister : Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires.

Sandor Clegane : I'll give you one try, girl.

Sandor Clegane : Kill me and you're free. But if I live, I'll break both your hands. Go on, hit me. Hit me hard.

Sandor Clegane : Sulk all you want. The truth is, you're lucky. You don't want to be alone out here, girl. Someone worse than me would find you.

Arya Stark : There's no one worse than you.

Sandor Clegane : Ha, you never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There's plenty worse than me. There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them.

Arya Stark : You're lying.

Sandor Clegane : Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open.

Arya Stark : Is that the Blackwater?

Sandor Clegane : The Blackwater? Where do you think I'm taking you?

Arya Stark : Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.

Sandor Clegane : Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins.

Arya Stark : But why?

Sandor Clegane : Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.

Arya Stark : Why would they be at the Twins?

Sandor Clegane : Those outlaws you love so much never told you? The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.

Barristan : Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted.

Jorah Mormont : They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.

Daenerys Targaryen : You know these men?

Jorah Mormont : Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, "The Titan's Bastard."

Daenerys Targaryen : Is he more titan or bastard?

Jorah Mormont : He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are.

Daenerys Targaryen : How many?

Barristan : Two thousand, Your Grace. Armored and mounted.

Daenerys Targaryen : Enough to make a difference?

Daenerys Targaryen : It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.

Jorah Mormont : I imagine you're right.

Daenerys Targaryen : I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.

Jorah Mormont : He may not agree to meet.

Daenerys Targaryen : He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.

Barristan : Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons- Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and-

Daario : Daario Naharis

Mero : You are the Mother of Dragons? I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.

Jorah Mormont : Mind your tongue.

Mero : Why? I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it.

Mero : You, slave girl, bring wine.

Daenerys Targaryen : We have no slaves here.

Mero : You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons.

Daenerys Targaryen : Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?

Barristan : Under two thousand, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : We have more, don't we?

Barristan : Ten thousand Unsullied.

Daenerys Targaryen : I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us.

Daario : I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have eight thousand Unsullied.

Daenerys Targaryen : You're very young to be a captain.

Prendahl : He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.

Daenerys Targaryen : Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side.

Mero : The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.

Jorah Mormont : The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.

Daenerys Targaryen : Or you could fight for me.

Mero : We've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.

Daenerys Targaryen : I would pay you as much and more.

Prendahl : Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again.

Daenerys Targaryen : Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.

Daario : You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry.

Daenerys Targaryen : A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide.

Mero : Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.

Grey Worm : My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?

Daenerys Targaryen : These men are our guests. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.

Mero : Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?

Daenerys Targaryen : A barrel, then.

Mero : Good. The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we'll all share you.

Mero : I'll come looking for you when this is over.

Daenerys Targaryen : Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first.

Barristan : Gladly, Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : Half Robert, half lowborn.

Melisandre : Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I'll come visit you soon.

Stannis Baratheon : What do you mean to do with him?

Melisandre : You know what I mean to do with him.

Stannis Baratheon : Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy.

Melisandre : Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?

Stannis Baratheon : No.

Melisandre : If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor.

Stannis Baratheon : You've slaughtered many lambs?

Melisandre : And none have seen the blade.

Davos : And tho- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod- rode Vhagar- Vhag-' Fuck me. 'Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog- enough- enough to swallow a horse whole.

Davos : Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : They feeding you enough?

Davos : Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain.

Stannis Baratheon : You don't belong in a place like this.

Davos : Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse.

Stannis Baratheon : Yeah.

Davos : I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.

Stannis Baratheon : Melisandre's returned.

Davos : I didn't know she'd been gone.

Stannis Baratheon : Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.

Davos : Why?

Stannis Baratheon : She says there's power in king's blood.

Davos : She's going to kill him.

Stannis Baratheon : Sacrifice him.

Davos : Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew.

Stannis Baratheon : What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?

Davos : Because he has your blood in his veins.

Stannis Baratheon : So did Renly.

Davos : Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent.

Stannis Baratheon : How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?

Davos : Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?

Stannis Baratheon : I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.

Davos : I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.

Stannis Baratheon : You have little regard for your own life.

Davos : Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night.

Stannis Baratheon : I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?

Prendahl : Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.

Daario : You talk too much.

Mero : She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.

Daario : Eight thousand Unsullied stand between her and your cock.

Mero : My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?

Daario : She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.

Mero : Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores.

Daario : I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I'm no whore, my friend.

Mero : She sells her sheath and you sell your blade. What's the difference?

Daario : I fight for beauty.

Prendahl : For beauty?

Mero : We fight for gold.

Daario : The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die- the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.

Mero : You'll die young.

Prendahl : What do we do about the dragon girl? We can't beat eight thousand Unsullied on the battlefield.

Mero : There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her.

Prendahl : She's well guarded.

Mero : Tonight's a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.

Prendahl : Which one of us?

Mero : Close your eyes, love.

Mero : Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking.

Daario : Do you hear me? Follow my voice. I'm right here.

Daario : You have something for me?

Daario : Valar morghulis.

Tyrion Lannister : Lady Sansa.

Sansa Stark : You look very handsome, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?

Tyrion Lannister : My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this.

Sansa Stark : I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel.

Sansa Stark : I doubt that very much, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.

Tyrion Lannister : But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?

Sansa Stark : When I have to.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, today you have to.

Margaery Tyrell : You look radiant, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : Radiant? Why radiant?

Margaery Tyrell : It's the word that came to mind.

Margaery Tyrell : We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends.

Cersei Lannister : You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice.

Margaery Tyrell : A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.

Cersei Lannister : Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?

Margaery Tyrell : Of course. They play it so often here at court.

Cersei Lannister : So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?

Margaery Tyrell : Not as well as you, I'm sure.

Cersei Lannister : House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?

Cersei Lannister : Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?

Margaery Tyrell : Gone.

Cersei Lannister : Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword.

Cersei Lannister : I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'

Cersei Lannister : If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep.

Sansa Stark : What are you doing?

Joffrey Lannister : Your father's gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband.

Septon : You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.

Tyrion Lannister : Could you-

Tyrion Lannister : Thank you.

Septon : Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever.

Melisandre : Have you ever seen one like it?

Gendry Baratheon : I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life.

Melisandre : It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth? When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it.

Gendry Baratheon : In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken.

Melisandre : Here, taste this.

Melisandre : You think I'm trying to poison you?

Gendry Baratheon : That's good.

Gendry Baratheon : That's really good.

Melisandre : Where do you think it's from?

Gendry Baratheon : I couldn't even guess.

Melisandre : Doesn't matter, does it? It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take.

Gendry Baratheon : That thought had crossed my mind, yeah.

Melisandre : There are no mistakes. Not for us.

Gendry Baratheon : I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.

Melisandre : Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us.

Gendry Baratheon : I don't understand. This- this doesn't seem very religious.

Melisandre : According to whom? The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you? Hmm? When you pray to them, what's their answer? A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see.

Melisandre : Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I.

Melisandre : Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me.

Gendry Baratheon : What are you doing?

Melisandre : You have to trust me.

Gendry Baratheon : What-? Get it away. Get it off me.

Melisandre : Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much.

Gendry Baratheon : Why are you doing this?

Melisandre : I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.

Gendry Baratheon : No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there!

Melisandre : You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration.

Gendry Baratheon : Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord!

Stannis Baratheon : The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

Olenna Tyrell : So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew? Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute.

Sansa Stark : Will you pardon me, my lord?

Tyrion Lannister : Of course. Of course. En-enjoy.

Cersei Lannister : Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.

Joffrey Lannister : I've got a lifetime for that.

Cersei Lannister : Stay.

Tywin Lannister : You seem rather drunk.

Tyrion Lannister : Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?

Tywin Lannister : This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible.

Tyrion Lannister : And?

Tywin Lannister : If you're going to give her one, you need to perform.

Tyrion Lannister : What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.

Tywin Lannister : More than once.

Tyrion Lannister : There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit.

Tywin Lannister : You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty.

Loras : Well, my father once told me-

Cersei Lannister : Nobody cares what your father once told you.

Joffrey Lannister : Congratulations, my lady.

Sansa Stark : Thank you, Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister. Soon you'll have a Lannister baby. It's a dream come true for you, isn't it? What a glorious day.

Sansa Stark : Yes, Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that?

Joffrey Lannister : You wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.

Joffrey Lannister : Time for the bedding ceremony.

Tyrion Lannister : There will be no bedding ceremony.

Joffrey Lannister : Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy.

Joffrey Lannister : There will be if I command it.

Tyrion Lannister : Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.

Joffrey Lannister : What did you say? What did you say?

Tywin Lannister : I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king.

Tyrion Lannister : A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there.

Tywin Lannister : Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace.

Tyrion Lannister : I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.

Tyrion Lannister : My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife.

Tyrion Lannister : I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood.

Sansa Stark : Is that wise, my lord?

Tyrion Lannister : Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion.

Sansa Stark : Is that wise, Tyrion?

Tyrion Lannister : Nothing was ever wiser.

Tyrion Lannister : Astoundingly long.

Sansa Stark : What?

Tyrion Lannister : Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?

Sansa Stark : Fourteen.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage.

Tyrion Lannister : Stop. I can't. I could, I won't.

Sansa Stark : But your father-

Tyrion Lannister : If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to.

Sansa Stark : What if I never want you to?

Tyrion Lannister : And so my watch begins.

Daenerys Targaryen : Ninteen

Missandei : Yes, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : How can anyone speak nineteen languages?

Missandei : It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.

Daenerys Targaryen : Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well?

Missandei : Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh.

Daenerys Targaryen : Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.

Missandei : Athjahakar.

Daenerys Targaryen : Athjahaka.

Missandei : Ath-ja-hakar.

Daenerys Targaryen : Athjahakar.

Daenerys Targaryen : Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice.

Missandei : Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace. The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue. It is the only proper language for poetry.

Daario : No screaming or she dies.

Daenerys Targaryen : What do you want?

Daario : You.

Daenerys Targaryen : Let her go.

Daario : Don't scream, lovely girl.

Daenerys Targaryen : You were sent here to kill me?

Daenerys Targaryen : So why haven't you?

Daario : I don't want to.

Daenerys Targaryen : What do your captains have to say about that?

Daario : You should ask them.

Daenerys Targaryen : Why?

Daario : We had philosophical differences.

Daenerys Targaryen : Over what?

Daario : Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.

Daenerys Targaryen : You're a strange man.

Daario : I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.

Daenerys Targaryen : And this is supposed to impress me?

Daario : Yes.

Daenerys Targaryen : Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?

Daario : They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.

Daenerys Targaryen : Will you fight for me?

Daenerys Targaryen : Swear to me.

Daario : The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis. My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours.

Tyrion Lannister : You really ought to knock.

Shae : I brought your breakfast.

Sam : It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.

Sam : How hard can it be to build a fire?

Gilly : It doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.

Sam : He winked at me before.

Gilly : I doubt it.

Sam : I saw him wink at me.

Gilly : He blinked.

Sam : I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.

Gilly : A what?

Sam : Well, I mean, there's no real difference.

Gilly : A wink is on purpose.

Sam : You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.

Gilly : Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?

Sam : What? No. This is just the way I talk.

Gilly : I'll build that fire.

Sam : Don't you think he should have a name?

Gilly : I don't know many boys' names.

Sam : Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jo,n Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer.

Gilly : Craster.

Sam : Uh, yes. Maybe that's not-

Gilly : Mormont.

Sam : That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name.

Gilly : Why is it a last name?

Sam : Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly.

Gilly : His name is Samwell Tarly, too?

Sam : No, Randyll Tarly.

Gilly : Randyll is a handsome name.

Sam : Please don't name him Randyll.

Gilly : Is your father cruel like mine?

Sam : Different manner of cruel.

Gilly : Not Randyll, then.

Gilly : Don't. Don't go out there.

Sam : I'll be back. I just want to look.

Sam : Go inside. Go back inside. I'll-

Gilly : It's come for the baby.

Sam : Stay back!

Sam : You stay back!

Gilly : No, you can't have him! No!

Gilly : No!

Catelyn Stark : Are you sure about this?

Robb Stark : No.

Catelyn Stark : It's dangerous.

Robb Stark : If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible. Take his home, take his gold, take his power.

Catelyn Stark : Why are you telling me?

Robb Stark : You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.

Robb Stark : Now Winterfell is burned to the ground. The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.

Robb Stark : So, Casterly Rock? I'm asking your advice.

Catelyn Stark : We have enough men?

Robb Stark : If Walder Frey cooperates.

Catelyn Stark : If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing, before we take the castle, we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea.

Robb Stark : We'll lose the war and die the way father died. Or worse.

Catelyn Stark : Show them how it feels to lose what they love.

Walder : My honored guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table. I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven.

Robb Stark : We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.

Robb Stark : I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness.

Walder : Don't beg my forgiveness, your Grace. It wasn't me you spurned, it was my girls.

Walder : One of them was supposed to be queen, now none of them are.

Walder : This is Arwyn, my daughter. My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra.

Walder : My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.

Walder : Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins. You could have had either. Could have had both for all I care.

Walder : My granddaughter Marianne. My granddaughter Freya. My granddaughter...W-W-Wertha? Waldra? Waldina?

Merry : I'm Merry.

Walder : Fine. And here's my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn't bled yet. Clearly you don't have the patience for all that.

Robb Stark : My ladies. All men should keep their word, kings most of all. I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow. The fault is not with you. Any man would be lucky to have any one of you. I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another. I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house. I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends.

Walder : Very good.

Walder : There she is. Come closer, let me have a look at you.

Walder : Still can't see you. Old eyes.

Walder : Love. That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh? Heh. Very honorable, I call it a pretty face. Mmmm, very pretty. Prettier than this lot, that's for sure. Very shapely as well. Oh, you try to hide her under that dress. If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place.

Walder : I can always see what's going on beneath a dress. Been at this a long time. I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is. Doesn't drop an inch.

Walder : Your king says he betrayed me for love. I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.

Walder : And I can respect that. When I was your age, I'd have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought. Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot. We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men.

Robb Stark : Thank you, my lord.

Walder : Well, let's get ready. The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we'll put this mess behind us.

Daenerys Targaryen : Where?

Daario : There.

Daario : There, it's a back gate. My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves.

Jorah Mormont : Your men but not you?

Daario : I have no interest in slaves. A man cannot make love to property.

Daario : This is where we enter the city. Very few guards, they know me. They let me inside.

Barristan : We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.

Daario : I kill the guards. I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates.

Daario : Then comes the army. Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours.

Jorah Mormont : Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army. The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners.

Daario : You have a very suspicious mind. In my experience, only dishonest people think this way.

Jorah Mormont : You command the Unsullied. What do you think?

Daenerys Targaryen : Lo jention mirre n��m��zme �?za, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa.

Grey Worm : I trust him.

Daenerys Targaryen : You leave tonight.

Jorah Mormont : Very good. We'll prepare.

Barristan : Ser Jorah. You can use an extra sword.

Jorah Mormont : You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan. Your place is by the Queen. If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done. No matter the cost, no matter our pride.

Sam Tarly : We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us. It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I. Too big, impossible to maintain. Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us. It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself. No one's used it for centuries, most likely. It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do.

Gilly : How do you know all that?

Sam Tarly : I read about it in a very old book.

Gilly : You know all that from staring at marks on paper?

Sam Tarly : Yes.

Gilly : You're like a wizard.

Gilly : Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived. Here we are. Alive.

Sandor Clegane : Remember what happens to children who run. I'm your father and I'll do the talking.

Pig Farmer : The roads have gone right to hell, haven't they? Cracked three spokes this morning.

Sandor Clegane : Need a hand?

Pig Farmer : Need about eight hands.

Pig Farmer : Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding.

Pig Farmer : Many thanks.

Arya Stark : Don't! Don't kill him.

Sandor Clegane : Dead rats don't squeak.

Arya Stark : You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people. A real hard man you are.

Sandor Clegane : More than anyone you know.

Arya Stark : You're wrong. I know a killer. A real killer.

Sandor Clegane : That so?

Arya Stark : You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger.

Sandor Clegane : That him?

Arya Stark : No.

Sandor Clegane : Good.

Arya Stark : Don't kill him! Please. Please don't.

Sandor Clegane : You're very kind. Someday it'll get you killed.

Osha : Where are we?

Bran Stark : The Gift, I think. Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night's Watch for their sustenance and support. Maester Luwin taught me that.

Jojen : Doesn't seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.

Meera : It's good land and there's no war up here. Why leave?

Bran Stark : Wildlings.

Bran Stark : Sorry. But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women.

Rickon : Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.

Rickon : That's what Old Nan said.

Jojen : There's a storm coming.

Bran Stark : I don't see any.

Meera : It's as good a place to shelter as any.

Osha : We can drink some blood while we wait. I don't need much.

Orell : Only one old man and eight good horses.

Tormund : What's one old man doing with eight horses?

Jon Snow : He breeds them for the Watch.

Ygritte : How's he keep folks from stealing them?

Jon Snow : The Watch protects him.

Orell : Not today they don't. He's selling horses, he's got some gold in there.

Tormund : And proper steel.

Orell : Let's carve him up.

Jon Snow : We just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat.

Orell : I keep telling you.

Ygritte : He's an old man. A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.

Jon Snow : The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.

Tormund : I hope so. Killing crows in their castle is tough. Killing them out here in the open, that's what we do.

Tormund : Spread out. Surround the hut and move in.

Jon Snow : Ygritte!

Tormund : Clear the barn!

Arya Stark : No one's going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.

Sandor Clegane : Best part of the animal.

Sandor Clegane : Don't worry, they're still there.

Arya Stark : I know they're still there.

Sandor Clegane : You check every five minutes like you're afraid they're gonna move.

Arya Stark : I'm not afraid.

Sandor Clegane : Of course you are. You're almost there and you're afraid you won't make it. The closer you get, the worse the fear gets. No point in trying to hide behind that face. I know fear when I see it. Seen it a lot.

Arya Stark : I knew fear when I saw it in you. You're afraid of fire.

Arya Stark : When Beric's sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl.

Arya Stark : And I know why, too. I heard what your brother did to you. Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop.

Sandor Clegane : That give you some ideas?

Arya Stark : Might do.

Sandor Clegane : Go ahead then. You might get away. Might even make it there on your own. They're just over the river. The closest you've been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy's neck.

Arya Stark : Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.

Bran Stark : How are we going to get past the Wall? My uncle said it's 700 feet high.

Bran Stark : How did you get past it?

Osha : Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.

Bran Stark : It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.

Osha : Some climb straight up the ice.

Bran Stark : Even Hodor's not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.

Hodor : Hodor!

Jojen : Nineteen castles guard the Wall. Only three are still manned.

Jojen : One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.

Bran Stark : My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.

Meera : Well, we'll have to open them up again.

Old Man : Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Meera : There's a rider out there.

Jojen : Just one?

Meera : There's more.

Osha : It's just thunder, sweet giant.

Hodor : Hodor.

Old Man : I yield. I yield.

Jojen : Wildlings.

Osha : Where's Shaggydog and Summer?

Bran Stark : Hunting.

Jojen : Shhh, quiet, Hodor.

Jojen : Make him shut up. If they hear us.

Bran Stark : To Hodor] Hush, Hodor. No, no more Hodoring.

Bran Stark : Hodor, calm down.

Osha : You need to keep quiet.

Jojen : They're gonna hear us.

Bran Stark : Hodor, be quiet.

Bran Stark : Hodor, calm down. Hodor, be quiet!

Meera : What did you do?

Bran Stark : Nothing. I don't know.

Rickon : What's That?

Osha : That's a horse dying.

Wildling : Bring them over here.

Wildling : That was the last of them. The rest are dead.

Orell : I heard shouting up there.

Tormund : Thunder.

Orell : I know the difference between shouting and thunder.

Tormund : Maybe it's ghosts.

Tormund : That won't help you, grandpa.

Tormund : Where you riding?

Old Man : Doesn't matter now, does it?

Tormund : No, it doesn't matter now.

Orell : Cut his throat or he'll tell the crows we're here.

Tormund : You understand.

Old Man : Let me stand at least.

Old Man : Let me go with a bit of dignity.

Orell : Make the crow kill him. You're one of us now. Prove it.

Jojen : The wolves are out there.

Bran Stark : I can't do it by choice. I don't know how. It happens in my dreams.

Jojen : You're a warg, Bran. It's in your blood.

Bran Stark : I can't.

Jojen : You just did, with him.

Jojen : A wolf is nothing compared to that.

Old Man : She looks sharp.

Ygritte : Do it. Do it.

Orell : Told ya. He's still one of them.

Tormund : Go on, boy.

Tormund : Go on!

Orell : He's a crow. He'll always be a crow. And here's his crow wife guarding him. He'll stab us in the back first chance he gets.

Tormund : Kill him!

Tormund : He's one of them!

Ygritte : No!

Tormund : Do you hear me?

Tormund : You're not gonna die for one of them.

Jojen : Do it. They'll find us if you don't.

Jon Snow : You were right the whole time.

Daario : When you hear a songbirdo s whistle, you come. I'm a great whistler, the greatest in the land.

Daario : Daario Naharis.

Daario : That one was quick.

Jorah Mormont : There may be others.

Daario : I doubt it. The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.

Jorah Mormont : That's what you call a few guards?

Roslin : Lord Edmure, I hope I'm not a disappointment to you.

Edmure : You're a delight to me, my lady.

Septon : You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.

Septon : In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity. Look upon each other and say the words.

Edmure Roslin : Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days.

Meera : Is that safe?

Osha : They're long gone.

Bran Stark : You were right. I can get inside Summer's mind whenever I want.

Jojen : Of course you can. North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals. But you did a lot more than that. You got inside Hodor's mind.

Bran Stark : They can't do that north of the Wall?

Jojen : No one can do that. Anywhere.

Bran Stark : When I was looking through Summer's eyes, I saw Jon.

Rickon : Where?

Bran Stark : He was with the wildlings. They tried to kill him but he got away.

Osha : He'll be heading back to Castle Black then. That's where we should go.

Bran Stark : For all we know, Castle Black's already under attack. If this many wildlings got through-

Osha : I already told you. I'm not going north of the Wall.

Bran Stark : Everything Jojen told me is true. You saw what I did to Hodor. I have to find the three-eyed raven.

Osha : Listen to me, little lord.

Bran Stark : Don't worry, I'm not asking you to come with me. It won't be safe for Rickon.

Rickon : Me? I'm coming with you.

Bran Stark : No. You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth. The Umbers are our bannermen. They'll protect you.

Rickon : I'm coming with you. I'm your brother. I have to protect you.

Bran Stark : Right now, I have to protect you.

Bran Stark : Robb's at war and I'm going beyond the Wall. If something happens to us, you're the heir to Winterfell.

Bran Stark : Will you know how to find the last Hearth?

Osha : You Southerners build your big castles and you never move. You're easy to find.

Rickon : We're not Southerners.

Rickon : And I don't want to leave you.

Osha : Shhh. Come here, little soldier. You and me, we're gonna have some adventures.

Bran Stark : You don't have to do any of this.

Osha : Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be. Shhh. We'll be fine, you and me. The Umbers are great warriors. Even I heard about them growing up. They'll teach you how to swing a sword.

Rickon : I know how to swing a sword.

Bran Stark : You're leaving now? It's the middle of the night.

Osha : I learned to walk in darkness.

Osha : Say your good-byes, little man.

Osha : Keep this one safe. He means the world to me.

Daenerys Targaryen : We've been waiting a long time. Haven't we? Well I don't know, you tell me. How long does it take to sack a city?

Jorah Mormont : It was just as you said. They did not believe until it was too late. Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.

Daenerys Targaryen : And Daario Naharis?

Daario : The city is yours, my queen.

Talisa : They're good, aren't they?

Lothar : They ought to be because they cost enough.

Blackfish : Look at the crowd there.

Catelyn Stark : He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him.

Blackfish : The Godo s love to reward a fool.

Catelyn Stark : Uncle.

Blackfish : What? He's my nephew, I love him. And he's a damned fool.

Catelyn Stark : Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?

Roose : Never do, my lady. Dulls the senses.

Blackfish : That's the point. Didn't you marry one of these Frey girls?

Roose : Aye. Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl's weight in silver as a dowry. So I have a fat, young bride.

Catelyn Stark : I hope she makes you very happy.

Roose : Well, she's made me very rich.

Blackfish : Pardon, my lord, my lady. I need to find a tree to piss on.

Robb Stark : My mother's alone with Roose Bolton. I should rescue her.

Talisa : Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I've ever met.

Robb Stark : Be kind. She's finally starting to like you.

Talisa : And I like her. But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis, playing my harp and you would be sitting over there , eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey's hand.

Robb Stark : Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.

Robb Stark : Striking your king is an act of treason.

Talisa : No, don't. Don't insult them.

Walder : Your Grace.

Walder : The Septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak. But they are not yet man and wife. A sword needs a sheath . And a wedding needs a bedding . What does my sire say?

Everybody : To bed! To bed! To bed!

Robb Stark : If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them.

Edmure : Ho-ho! Careful now, ladies. Once you set that monster free, there's no caging him again .

Catelyn Stark : Poor girl.

Roose : Every bride suffers the same. I'm sure you endured yours with grace.

Catelyn Stark : Oh, Ned forbade it. He said it wouldn't be right if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night.

Talisa : That is a very strange custom.

Robb Stark : I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective.

Talisa : It seems normal to you?

Robb Stark : It's tradition. Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage.

Talisa : No, but there are other ways of providing proof.

Robb Stark : Boy or girl?

Talisa : I don't know. But if it's a boy, I know what we should name him.

Robb Stark : Oh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming.

Talisa : Eddard. Don't you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?

Robb Stark : I do.

Sandor Clegane : Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Frey Guard : Where are you going?

Sandor Clegane : Got salt pork for the feast.

Frey Guard : The feast is over.

Sandor Clegane : It doesn't sound like it's over.

Frey Guard : If I tell you it's over, it's over. Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here.

Sandor Clegane : Got pig's feet, too .

Frey Guard : Are you soft in the head? Turn this cart around!

Walder : I feel I've been remiss in my duties.

Walder : I've given you meat and wine and music but I haven't shown you the hospitality you deserve. My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.

Catelyn Stark : Robb!

Man : You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh?

Man : Feast over yet, is it?

Frey Man : Aye, it's over!

Sandor Clegane : It's too late.

Walder : The King in the North arises, heh heh.

Catelyn Stark : Lord Walder! Lord Walder, enough! Let it end! Please! He is my son! My first son! Let him go and I swear that we will forget this! I swear it by the Old Gods and New! We will take no vengeance.

Walder : You already swore me one oath right here in my castle. You swore by all the Gods, your son would marry my daughter!

Catelyn Stark : Take me for a hostage but let Robb go! Robb, get up! Get up and walk out! Please! Please!

Walder : And why I would let him do that?

Catelyn Stark : On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife's throat!

Walder : I'll find another.

Robb Stark : Mother.

Roose : The Lannisters send their regards.

Man : It's too late.

Man : Yah! Yah!

Man : Go, move out!

Frey Men : The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!

Frey Men : The King in the North! The King in the North!

Frey Man : Here comes the King in the North! Here comes the King in the North!

Frey Man : Here comes

Tyrion Lannister : Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

Sansa Stark : What are you doing?

Tyrion Lannister : I have a list.

Sansa Stark : A list of people you mean to kill?

Tyrion Lannister : For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-

Sansa Stark : You should learn to ignore them.

Tyrion Lannister : My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp.

Sansa Stark : You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.

Tyrion Lannister : The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.

Sansa Stark : So how should we punish them?

Tyrion Lannister : Who? Whom?

Sansa Stark : Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.

Sansa Stark : I hear that you're a pervert.

Tyrion Lannister : I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.

Sansa Stark : We could sheep shift Lord Desmondo s bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from.

Tyrion Lannister : Lady Sansa!

Sansa Stark : My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.

Tyrion Lannister : Why sheep shift?

Sansa Stark : That's the vulgar word for dung.

Tyrion Lannister : My lady-

Sansa Stark : Well, you asked me.

Girl : Oh! That's him!

Podrick : My lord, my lady. Your father has called a meeting of the small council.

Tyrion Lannister : Killed a few puppies today?

Joffrey Lannister : Show him. Come on, show him.

Pycelle : Oh, apologies, my lord. Old fingers.

Tyrion Lannister : Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?

Joffrey Lannister : Robb Stark is dead. And his bitch mother. Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head. I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.

Varys : Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage.

Cersei Lannister : A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.

Joffrey Lannister : Yes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast.

Tyrion Lannister : No. She is no longer yours to torment.

Joffrey Lannister : Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.

Joffrey Lannister : I could have your tongue out for saying that.

Cersei Lannister : Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.

Pycelle : Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste.

Joffrey Lannister : I am the king! I will punish you.

Tywin Lannister : Any man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you.

Joffrey Lannister : My father won the real war. He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!

Tywin Lannister : The king is tired. See him to his chambers.

Cersei Lannister : Come along.

Joffrey Lannister : I'm not tired.

Cersei Lannister : We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.

Tywin Lannister : Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep.

Joffrey Lannister : I'm not tired!

Cersei Lannister : Come.

Tywin Lannister : Not you.

Tyrion Lannister : You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.

Tywin Lannister : You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.

Tyrion Lannister : A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.

Tywin Lannister : You really think a crown gives you power?

Tyrion Lannister : No. I think armies give you power.

Tywin Lannister : Mm-hmm.

Tyrion Lannister : Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances.

Tywin Lannister : Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?

Tyrion Lannister : I'm all for cheating. This is war.

Tywin Lannister : But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.

Tyrion Lannister : So that's why you did it? To save lives?

Tywin Lannister : To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.

Tyrion Lannister : The Northerners will never forget.

Tywin Lannister : Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.

Tywin Lannister : I believe you still have some work to do on that score.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?

Tywin Lannister : One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant.

Tyrion Lannister : I will not rape her.

Tywin Lannister : Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?

Tyrion Lannister : Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.

Tywin Lannister : The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.

Tywin Lannister : Does that amuse you?

Tyrion Lannister : No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions.

Tywin Lannister : Easy for me, is it?

Tyrion Lannister : When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?

Tywin Lannister : The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister : Sansa.

Meera : It's empty.

Jojen : Let's find a place to sleep.

Hodor : Hodor. Hodor.

Bran Stark : Don't, Hodor.

Bran Stark : Maybe we shouldn't stay.

Meera : You'd rather be out there?

Bran Stark : There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.

Jojen : I always quite liked the horrible stories.

Bran Stark : So did I. Once.

Bran Stark : You ever heard about the Rat Cook?

Meera : No. Who's he?

Bran Stark : Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry.

Meera : If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat-

Bran Stark : It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive.

Walder Frey : The late Walder Frey,' old Hoster called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter Catelyn's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and I'm Lord of Riverrun.

Roose Bolton : The Blackfish escaped.

Walder Frey : An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?

Roose Bolton : As you say.

Walder Frey : They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?

Roose Bolton : You'll be needing a new young girl.

Walder Frey : Yeah. Got that to look forward to.

Walder Frey : And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country.

Roose Bolton : He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant-

Walder Frey : Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?

Walder Frey : Well, here's to the Young Wolf!

Roose Bolton : Forever young.

Walder Frey : Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?

Roose Bolton : At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.

Walder Frey : Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing.

Roose Bolton : I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out. Robb Stark offered amnesty for the Ironborn if they gave us Theon.

Walder Frey : Oh. And?

Roose Bolton : Ramsay delivered the terms. The Ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But Ramsay- well Ramsay has his own way of doing things.

Ramsay Bolton : Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock.

Ramsay Bolton : What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?

Ramsay Bolton : People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?

Ramsay Bolton : Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?

Ramsay Bolton : Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.

Ramsay Bolton : But my father taught me to aim for their head.

Theon Greyjoy : Kill me.

Ramsay Bolton : Sorry, what?

Ramsay Bolton : A little louder.

Theon Greyjoy : Kill me!

Ramsay Bolton : You're no good to me dead. We need you.

Ramsay Bolton : You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat.

Ramsay Bolton : Stinking meat.

Ramsay Bolton : You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?

Theon Greyjoy : Theon Greyjoy.

Ramsay Bolton : What's your name?

Theon Greyjoy : Th- Theon Greyjoy.

Theon Greyjoy : Please.

Ramsay Bolton : What is your name?!

Theon Greyjoy : Reek. My name is Reek.

Bran Stark : Hodor.

Sam : Don't kill me!

Meera : Who are you?

Gilly : Sam! Sam!

Meera : Who are you?!

Gilly : Gilly. Don't hurt us.

Jojen : Where are you going?

Sam : To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.

Bran Stark : My brother, he's in the Night's-

Jojen : Shush.

Sam : Who's your brother?

Jojen : Doesn't matter.

Sam : You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.

Bran Stark : No, I'm not.

Sam : I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor.

Hodor : Hodor.

Sam : I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will.

Bran Stark : Take us north of the Wall.

Sam : What? Why in the world would you want to go-

Bran Stark : I don't want to. I have to.

Jojen : How did you get through the Wall?

Meera : Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?

Sam : Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.

Gilly : Come with us. There's nothing north but death.

Sam : If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you.

Jojen : There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.

Sam : What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way.

Jojen : You saw the White Walkers and the army of the dead.

Sam : How do you know all that?

Jojen : The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.

Sam : But you're going to stop them?

Bran Stark : Please, Sam. I have to go north. I have to.

Balon : Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North. I give you until the full moon to order all Ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home.

Balon : On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still in our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the twenty Ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him.'

Balon : Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.' Get that out of my sight.

Balon : Theon disobeyed my orders.

Balon : The boy is a fool. He cannot further the Greyjoy line. I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken. Get this away from me.

Yara Greyjoy : He's your son.

Balon : Son? He's not a man anymore.

Yara Greyjoy : He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.

Balon : Watch yourself. I've made my decision.

Yara Greyjoy : And I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.

Yara Greyjoy : I'm going to choose the fifty best killers on the Iron Islands.

Man : Get those ropes!

Yara Greyjoy : I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water. I'm going to march on the Dreadfort. I'm going to find my little brother and I'm going to bring him home.

Bran Stark : What is it?

Jojen : Dragonglass.

Sam : We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.

Bran Stark : Why? What are they for?

Sam : Killing White Walkers.

Meera : How do you know that?

Gilly : The Walker came for my baby. And Sam-

Meera : But no one's killed a White Walker in thousands of years.

Sam : Well, I suppose someone had to be the first.

Bran Stark : Take it, Hodor.

Sam : And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us.

Bran Stark : I wish I could. I really do.

Davos : How are you keeping?

Gendry Baratheon : Great. Never better.

Davos : It was just a bit of blood.

Gendry Baratheon : I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want.

Davos : I'm not a highborn.

Gendry Baratheon : She called you Ser. I heard it.

Davos : A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.

Gendry Baratheon : Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help.

Davos : I lived below the Street of Flour.

Gendry Baratheon : How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?

Davos : The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.

Gendry Baratheon : Gin Alley.

Davos : The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king.

Gendry Baratheon : Yeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me.

Davos : If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?

Gendry Baratheon : You're me. Never been with a woman. Never talked to a woman, really. And then she comes at you- big words, no clothes. What would you have done?

Davos : She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that.

Gendry Baratheon : So how'd you become a lord?

Davos : Oh, that's a long story.

Gendry Baratheon : Better not, then. I'm a bit busy.

Davos : Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.

Gendry Baratheon : You see? Highborns.

Davos : I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.

Gendry Baratheon : Why did you?

Davos : I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.

Gendry Baratheon : Does he?

Davos : He's dead.

Gendry Baratheon : How'd he die?

Davos : Following me.

Varys : When did you come to this strange country?

Shae : When I was thirteen.

Varys : You were only a child.

Shae : I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that.

Varys : You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking.

Shae : And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.

Varys : She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.

Shae : I love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me?

Varys : No, I expect not.

Shae : She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.

Varys : We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-

Shae : I have a name.

Varys : You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.

Shae : What do you want from me, Lord Varys?

Varys : Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up.

Shae : Why do you want me to leave?

Varys : Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time.

Shae : Lord Varys.

Shae : If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself.

Tyrion Lannister : Keep up.

Podrick : I don't think I can, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy.

Cersei Lannister : Leave.

Cersei Lannister : So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend.

Tyrion Lannister : She doesn't deserve this.

Cersei Lannister : Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.

Tyrion Lannister : There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.

Tyrion Lannister : Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?

Cersei Lannister : I won't be marrying Ser Loras.

Tyrion Lannister : I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.

Cersei Lannister : You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.

Tyrion Lannister : So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?

Cersei Lannister : So she can have some happiness in her life.

Tyrion Lannister : You have children. How happy would you say you are?

Cersei Lannister : Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive.

Tyrion Lannister : Even Joffrey?

Cersei Lannister : Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own.

Tyrion Lannister : How long does it go on?

Cersei Lannister : Until we've dealt with all our enemies.

Tyrion Lannister : Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more.

Cersei Lannister : Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.

Frey Soldier : I'm telling you, that's what she did. Sounded like a cow in heat.

Frey Soldier : Aye, not for long.

Frey Soldier : That's right. Black Walder shut her up right quick. None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.

Frey Soldier : I'll tell you what, though. The hardest thing was getting that wolf's head to stay on the body.

Frey Soldier : You sewed it on?

Frey Soldier : I did.

Frey Soldier : I bet there were a thousand men claiming they were the one.

Frey Soldier : It was me. And Malcolm and Talbott. Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time. Took the skin right with it. What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone. Give it a nice firm mooring and-

Frey Soldier : What do you want?

Arya Stark : Mind if I keep warm?

Frey Soldier : Fuck off.

Arya Stark : But I'm hungry.

Frey Soldier : Does fuck off mean something different where you're from?

Arya Stark : I've got money.

Frey Soldier : What kind of coin is that?

Arya Stark : It's worth a lot.

Arya Stark : Sorry.

Frey Soldier : Little shit.

Frey Soldier : Fool!

Sandor Clegane : Where did you get the knife?

Arya Stark : From you.

Sandor Clegane : Is that the first man you've killed?

Arya Stark : The first man.

Sandor Clegane : Next time you're going to do something like that, tell me first.

Arya Stark : Valar morghulis.

Jon Snow : Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am.

Jon Snow : I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me.

Ygritte : You know nothing, Jon Snow.

Jon Snow : I do know some things. I know I love you.

Jon Snow : I know you love me. But I have to go home now.

Sam : I know how this must look. What I meant was-

Gilly : I swear to you, my lord-

Maester Aemon : I'm not a lord, my dear. Not for many, many years. Every man who joins the Night's Watch renounces all former titles. Among other things. What is your name?

Gilly : Gilly.

Maester Aemon : Ah, for the gillyflower. Lovely.

Gilly : Yes, my-

Sam : Maester.

Gilly : Master.

Maester Aemon : And the child?

Sam : She hasn't chosen a name yet.

Gilly : His name is Sam.

Maester Aemon : Tarly do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order?

Sam : He's not my child, Maester Aemon. She's one of Craster's wives. I remember every word of the oath. Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build five hundred miles of ice walls seve hundred feet high to keep men out. The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us.

Maester Aemon : Gilly, you and your son will be our guests for the time being. We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall.

Gilly : Thank you Maester. I can cook and clean and I can-

Maester Aemon : Good. Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell. I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay.

Sam : Miles better.

Maester Aemon : We had forty-four ravens at last count. Make sure they're all fed. Every one of them flies tonight.

Davos : To His Grace King Stannis Baratheon. Invaded- inv- invit- invited to the name day celebration for Rylene Florent on the first nigit-

Shireen : Night.

Davos : First night of the full moon.' Why is there a G in night?

Shireen : I don't know. There just is.

Davos : Well, your father's not going to go to that.

Shireen : My books are better than these boring scrolls. You could read about Balerion the Dread. They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep. I'd like to see that someday.

Davos : I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.

Shireen : His fangs were as long as bastard swords.

Davos : Aye, old Balerion's definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene's got on offer. But now that I'm your father's Hand again, I have to keep him informed. The king does not have time for this drudgery. 'To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros.'

Shireen : Noblemen.

Davos : Noblemen of Westeros, the Nig- the Night's Watch implores-

Shireen : What is it?

Shireen : Why are they ringing the bells? Are we being attacked?

Davos : Stay here. Bar the door.

Stannis Baratheon : The usurper Robb Stark is dead. Betrayed by his bannerman.

Davos : And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?

Melisandre : I take no credit. I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.

Davos : Your Grace, the world has got so far bent. I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open. I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong. It is evil. And you are not an evil man.

Stannis Baratheon : Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?

Davos : Aegon Targaryen.

Stannis Baratheon : And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?

Davos : On the back of his dragon, Balerion the Dread.

Stannis Baratheon : He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons. Dragons are magic, Ser Davos. My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal.

Davos : You do not need to burn the boy. If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark-

Melisandre : And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne. A great gift requires a great sacrifice.

Davos : His name is Gendry. He's a good lad. A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew.

Stannis Baratheon : What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?

Davos : Everything.

Stannis Baratheon : The boy must die.

Gendry Baratheon : What are you doing?

Davos : You're leaving.

Gendry Baratheon : Is this some kind of trick?

Davos : Yes, but not on you.

Davos : Aim for that star. Don't stop. There's bread and water. Go slow with it. If you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get, don't drink seawater.

Gendry Baratheon : I know not to drink seawater.

Davos : Row for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest. You'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you.

Gendry Baratheon : Where should I go?

Davos : You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing.

Gendry Baratheon : The gold cloaks are looking for me.

Davos : They were looking for me for twenty years. Do they know your face?

Gendry Baratheon : No.

Davos : I'd worry more about the Red Woman.

Davos : The other way.

Davos : You ever been in a boat before?

Gendry Baratheon : You know how to swim?

Davos : Don't fall out. Go on.

Gendry Baratheon : Why are you doing this?

Davos : Because it's right. And because I'm a slow learner.

Davos : When you get to Flea Bottom, have a bowl of brown for me.

Guard : Horse approaching! Halt! Halt!

Sam : Jon! Jon! Jon, it's us.

Pyp : I don't think he can see us.

Jon Snow : Pyp? Sam?

Sam : Hush, now. You're home. Carry him inside. Gently.

Man : Out of the way. Step aside, country boy. People working here.

Jaime Lannister : Cersei.

Stannis Baratheon : You don't deny it?

Davos : No. I let him go.

Melisandre : Your mercy saved the boy's life. You feel good about that?

Davos : Aye, I do.

Melisandre : You saved one innocent. How many tens of thousands have you doomed?

Davos : There has got to be another way.

Stannis Baratheon : What other way?! Tell us about this other way.

Davos : I don't know, Your Grace. I can't see the future in the fire.

Stannis Baratheon : Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth. I, Stannis of the House Baratheon, First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, sentence you to die.

Davos : I understand. But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King, it is my duty to advise you against it. You're gonna need me.

Melisandre : Take him away.

Stannis Baratheon : Why am I gonna need you?

Melisandre : My king.

Davos : It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch. Their Lord Commander is dead. Took a ranging party north and never made it back. One lad did, though. What he saw beyond the Wall- it's coming for all of us.

Stannis Baratheon : When did you learn to read?

Davos : Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.

Melisandre : This War of Five Kings means nothing. The true war lies to the north, my king. Death marches on the Wall. Only you can stop him.

Davos : You can't stop him alone. You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side.

Stannis Baratheon : I've made my decision.

Melisandre : He's right. You need him. He has a part to play in the war to come.

Stannis Baratheon : You see, Ser Davos? You've been saved by that fire god you like to mock. You're in his army now.

Barristan : They will come, Your Grace. When they're ready.

Daenerys Targaryen : Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.

Jorah Mormont : You didn't conquer them. You liberated them.

Daenerys Targaryen : People learn to love their chains.

Missandei : This is Daenerys Targaryen, the Stormborn, the Unburnt, the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, Mother of Dragons. It is to her you owe your freedom

Daenerys Targaryen : No.

Daenerys Targaryen : You do not owe me your freedom. I cannot give it to you. Your freedom is not mine to give. It belongs to you and you alone. If you want it back, you must take it for yourselves. Each and every one of you.

Man : Mhysa!

Daughter : Mhysa!

Crowd : Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

Daenerys Targaryen : What does it mean?

Missandei : It is old Ghiscari, khaleesi. It means 'mother'.

Crowd : Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa.

Daenerys Targaryen : It's all right. These people won't hurt me.

Daenerys Targaryen : Fly.

Daenerys Targaryen : Let me pass

Crowd : Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa. Mhysa!

Jaime Lannister : Magnificent.

Tywin Lannister : Mm-hmm.

Jaime Lannister : Looks fresh-forged.

Tywin Lannister : It is.

Jaime Lannister : No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.

Tywin Lannister : There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.

Jaime Lannister : Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?

Tywin Lannister : From someone who no longer had need of it.

Jaime Lannister : You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.

Tywin Lannister : And now we have two.

Jaime Lannister : Two?

Tywin Lannister : The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.

Jaime Lannister : Well, thank you. It's glorious.

Tywin Lannister : You'll have to train your left hand.

Jaime Lannister : Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.

Tywin Lannister : You'll never be as good.

Jaime Lannister : No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter.

Tywin Lannister : You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.

Jaime Lannister : Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.

Tywin Lannister : The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.

Jaime Lannister : How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?

Tywin Lannister : Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.

Jaime Lannister : Home?

Tywin Lannister : You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.

Jaime Lannister : You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.

Tywin Lannister : I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.

Jaime Lannister : You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.

Tywin Lannister : You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.

Jaime Lannister : No.

Tywin Lannister : No?

Tywin Lannister : I don't believe I asked you a question.

Jaime Lannister : There's my answer.

Tywin Lannister : If you think your bloody honor comes before...

Jaime Lannister : My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children.

Tywin Lannister : What do you want?

Jaime Lannister : Supper would be nice.

Tywin Lannister : For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve.

Jaime Lannister : I suppose you want the sword back.

Tywin Lannister : Keep it.

Tywin Lannister : A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.

Bronn : How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?

Tyrion Lannister : Please don't.

Bronn : Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside.

Tyrion Lannister : This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends.

Bronn : If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?

Tyrion Lannister : There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.

Bronn : And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?

Tyrion Lannister : No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.

Bronn : Oh.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah, here we are.

Tyrion Lannister : Can you read the sigils?

Bronn : Yellow balls?

Podrick : Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood. A vulture grasping a baby in it's talons, House Blackmont. A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.

Tyrion Lannister : Boy knows his Dornish Houses.

Bronn : I need a sigil.

Tyrion Lannister : And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?

Podrick : I don't see it, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company.

Dornish Lord : The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear. He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast.

Dornish Lord : Will he?

Tyrion Lannister : And where is Prince Oberyn?

Dornish Lord : Arrived before dawn. Not a man for welcome parties, our prince.

Tyrion Lannister : Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep.

Tyrion Lannister : You must be weary after such a long journey.

Bronn : Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?

Tyrion Lannister : We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.

Bronn : How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?

Tyrion Lannister : You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?

Bronn : I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old.

Oberyn Martell : Look at this one. How lovely is she?

Ellaria : Beautiful. But pale.

Oberyn Martell : They like them pale in the capital. Shows they don't work the fields.

Oberyn Martell : You like?

Ellaria : Timid. Timid bores me.

Oberyn Martell : You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?

Oberyn Martell : I think she likes you. ELLARIA" She has good taste.

Oberyn Martell : You're not timid, are you?

Ellaria : Not timid.

Oberyn Martell : Do you like women?

Whore : When they look like her, my lord.

Ellaria : This one will do nicely.

Olyvar : Very good, my lady.

Ellaria : Oh, I'm not a lady.

Olyvar : A term of courtesy in this establishment.

Ellaria : A lie anywhere. Why not use the right words? I'm a bastard. She is a whore. And you're what? A procurer.

Olyvar : Any of the others?

Oberyn Martell : The two girls can leave.

Oberyn Martell : You stay.

Olyvar : I'm afraid I'm not an offer, my lord.

Oberyn Martell : Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer. Take off your clothes. We'll be here a while.

Olyvar : My lord.

Oberyn Martell : I am a prince, boy. Have you ever been with a prince?

Olyvar : Can't say I have. I'm wildly expensive.

Oberyn Martell : Take off your clothes.

Olyvar : Which way do you like it?

Oberyn Martell : My way .

Morgan : And so he spoke and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere. And now the rains

Ellaria : Oberyn.

Morgan : Weep o'er his hall...

Ellaria : Oberyn, don't.

Morgan : With no one there to hear Yes, not the rains weep o'er his hall And not a soul to hear.

Morgans Friend : You lost, friend?

Oberyn Martell : Forgive me for staring. I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.

Morgans Friend : I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.

Oberyn Martell : We don't like the smell.

Ellaria : Come with me, lover.

Morgan : Gods, look at this one.

Olyvar : Sirs, if you follow me, I'll arrange for a private room.

Morgan : Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman? Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil.

Oberyn Martell : Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?

Oberyn Martell : You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone. May I tell you a secret? You're not a golden lion. You're just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.

Oberyn Martell : Longsword is a bad option in close quarters. When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding. Quite a lot, I'm afraid. So many veins in the wrist.

Oberyn Martell : He'll live if you get him help straightaway. So, decisions.

Tyrion Lannister : Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be...

Tyrion Lannister : trouble.

Oberyn Martell : Apologies, my love.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm here to welcome you to the capital.

Oberyn Martell : Ellaria Sand, my paramour. The king's own Uncle Imp. Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister : If there's anything I can do to make your stay...

Oberyn Martell : What are you? His hired killer?

Bronn : It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight.

Oberyn Martell : How did that come to pass?

Bronn : Killed the right people, I suppose.

Oberyn Martell : We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, I partook. Now I'm married.

Tyrion Lannister : Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?

Oberyn Martell : Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, they take all kinds.

Oberyn Martell : Even Dornishmen.

Tyrion Lannister : The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.

Oberyn Martell : Let us speak truth here. Joffrey is insulted. I am only the second son after all.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult.

Tyrion Lannister : Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?

Oberyn Martell : I was invited to the royal wedding.

Tyrion Lannister : I thought we were speaking truth.

Oberyn Martell : The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city...

Tyrion Lannister : I wasn't actually present.

Oberyn Martell : And butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister, you know what they did to her?

Oberyn Martell : I'm asking you a question.

Tyrion Lannister : I've heard rumors.

Oberyn Martell : So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword.

Tyrion Lannister : I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.

Oberyn Martell : If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.

Jorah Mormont : They're dragons, Khaleesi. They can never be tamed. Not even by their mother.

Daenerys Targaryen : Ser Barristan.

Barristan : Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm?

Barristan : Gambling, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : Gambling?

Crowd : Mhysa. Mhysa. Mhysa...

Daenerys Targaryen : How long have they been at it?

Missandei : Since midnight, Your Grace.

Daario : Ser Worm is stronger than he looks. But I can see his arms beginning to shake.

Daenerys Targaryen : What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?

Daario : The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.

Daenerys Targaryen : That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.

Daenerys Targaryen : The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for.

Daario : You like this girl? Must be frustrating.

Grey Worm : You are not a smart man, Daario Naharis.

Daario : I'd rather have no brains and two balls.

Shae : You need to eat something.

Shae : Pigeon pie.

Sansa Stark : No, thank you.

Shae : Lemon cakes?

Shae : You love lemon cakes.

Shae : Tell her she needs to eat.

Tyrion Lannister : My lady, you do need to eat.

Sansa Stark : I don't need to eat.

Tyrion Lannister : If I could have a moment alone with my wife.

Shae : She needs to eat.

Tyrion Lannister : I can't let you starve.

Tyrion Lannister : I swore to protect you.

Tyrion Lannister : My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you.

Sansa Stark : How can you help me?

Tyrion Lannister : I don't know, but I can try.

Sansa Stark : I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died.

Tyrion Lannister : I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.

Sansa Stark : Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.

Tyrion Lannister : What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true.

Sansa Stark : Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear.

Sansa Stark : I don't pray anymore. It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me.

Shae : My lion.

Tyrion Lannister : What are you doing?

Shae : What does it look like I'm doing? Come here.

Tyrion Lannister : How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.

Shae : I know. I know. We have come to a dangerous place. Have you forgotten me? Do you know how long it's been?

Tyrion Lannister : Of course I haven't forgotten.

Shae : I want you. Don't you want me?

Tyrion Lannister : Things are a bit tense right now.

Shae : What things?

Tyrion Lannister : My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.

Shae : You need to relax.

Shae : Don't you want to relax?

Shae : What's wrong?

Tyrion Lannister : I told you. It's not a good time.

Shae : It's never a good time. You have your child bride now.

Tyrion Lannister : Shae.

Shae : Do you love her?

Tyrion Lannister : Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.

Shae : That's not an answer.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course I don't love her.

Shae : You tried to ship me away.

Tyrion Lannister : Ship you away?

Shae : Give me diamonds and make me disappear.

Tyrion Lannister : What in the world are you talking about?

Shae : If you want me to leave, just say it. Say it!

Tyrion Lannister : Shh. I don't know what you're talking about.

Shae : You want me to stay?

Qyburn : A work of art, really. The craftsmanship is excellent.

Jaime Lannister : You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it.

Cersei Lannister : Such an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right.

Jaime Lannister : Days?

Cersei Lannister : Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?

Jaime Lannister : Uh... a hook would be more practical.

Cersei Lannister : Elegant, I think.

Cersei Lannister : Thank you for your help with the other matter.

Qyburn : The symptoms have abated?

Cersei Lannister : Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn.

Qyburn : Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help whenever I can.

Jaime Lannister : Odd little man.

Cersei Lannister : I've grown rather fond of him. He's quite talented, you know?

Jaime Lannister : What symptoms?

Cersei Lannister : Symptoms that are not your concern.

Jaime Lannister : You let him touch you?

Cersei Lannister : You jealous?

Jaime Lannister : I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.

Cersei Lannister : You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.

Jaime Lannister : I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.

Cersei Lannister : Well, they smell like Pycelle.

Jaime Lannister : You drink more than you used to.

Cersei Lannister : Yes.

Jaime Lannister : Why?

Cersei Lannister : Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident.

Jaime Lannister : It must have been traumatic for you.

Cersei Lannister : My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.

Jaime Lannister : A rather short siege.

Cersei Lannister : A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So...

Jaime Lannister : Father disowned me today.

Cersei Lannister : He can't disown you. You're all he's got.

Jaime Lannister : You're forgetting Tyrion.

Cersei Lannister : You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?

Jaime Lannister : Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.

Cersei Lannister : Not now.

Jaime Lannister : I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.

Jaime Lannister : Something's changed.

Cersei Lannister : Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?

Jaime Lannister : What do you want me to apologize for?

Cersei Lannister : For leaving me.

Jaime Lannister : You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?

Cersei Lannister : Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.

Jaime Lannister : Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you.

Cersei Lannister : You took too long.

Jaime Lannister : I... What are you saying?

Cersei Lannister : I'm saying you took too long.

Cersei Lannister : Come in.

Jaime Lannister : Go away.

Marei : Forgive me, Your Grace. You told me to come at once if there was anything important.

Tormund : You plan on killing all the crows yourself?

Ygritte : Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter?

Tormund : We wait for Mance's orders.

Ygritte : You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon. If he's not back yet, he's not coming back.

Tormund : And what is it you want? March on Castle Black with just this lot? Your pretty crow said 1,000 men are nesting there.

Ygritte : Yeah, well, he's a liar.

Tormund : He is? Shouldn't it be "he was"? You said you put three arrows in him.

Ygritte : I did.

Tormund : I've seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards. If that boy's still walking, it's 'cause you let him go.

Tormund : Thenns. I fucking hate Thenns.

Tormund : Mance sent you?

Tormund : How did you find us?

Tormund : You came from the south, not the north.

Warg : Took a detour. Got some supper from a village down that way.

Styr : Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?

Tormund : Help yourself.

Styr : Maybe everything's just better fed down here.

Styr : Fat and lazy. Easier for us, hmm?

Styr : You didn't see us coming? Lost your warg? And that baby crow you had with you, lost him too?

Tormund : I'll answer to Mance. I won't answer to you.

Styr : She yours?

Ygritte : I'm not anybody's.

Styr : Too scrawny. Not like those crows at Castle Black.

Styr : Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled.

Styr : I know we've had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow.

Officer : Draw. Loose.

Jon Snow : Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. "He said, " Next time I see you, you'll be all in black." I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could.

Sam : Sometimes I want to hate you.

Sam : Well, you're better than me at everything. Except reading.

Sam : They're... they're ready for you.

Jon Snow : He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.

Sam : No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.

Jon Snow : I've done plenty wrong.

Alliser Thorne : So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?

Jon Snow : I didn't murder him.

Alliser Thorne : No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that?

Jon Snow : He wanted me to kill him.

Janos Slynt : A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?

Jon Snow : The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.

Alliser Thorne : Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother.

Jon Snow : Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him...

Janos Slynt : The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.

Jon Snow : Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl.

Janos Slynt : You admit to breaking your vows, then?

Jon Snow : I do.

Janos Slynt : The law is the law. The boy must die.

Maester Aemon : If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men.

Alliser Thorne : There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.

Jon Snow : While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000.

Alliser Thorne : Impossible. You can't get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other.

Jon Snow : 100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him.

Janos Slynt : Giants?

Jon Snow : Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?

Janos Slunt : I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy.

Jon Snow : And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.

Janos Slynt : How dare you?!

Jon Snow : There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.

Jon Snow : Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?

Maester Aemon : None of us are free. We are men of the Night's Watch. But we won't be taking your head today, Jon Snow. Go on.

Alliser Thorne : I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon.

Maester Aemon : Yes, you are.

Alliser Thorne : And I don't trust the bastard.

Maester Aemon : He told the truth.

Alliser Thorne : And you always know when a man's telling a lie? How did you acquire this magical power?

Maester Aemon : I grew up in King's Landing.

Olenna Tyrell : No. No. You're a queen, not an ox.

Olenna Tyrell : Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.

Margaery Tyrell : The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother. You can't say no to everything.

Olenna Tyrell : Nonsense.

Olenna Tyrell : My little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best.

Olenna Tyrell : The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that.

Margaery Tyrell : Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me. End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.

Olenna Tyrell : You watch that. Even here, even with me.

Olenna Tyrell : My word.

Brienne : My lady. My lady. Please pardon me for interrupting. My name is Brienne of Tarth.

Olenna Tyrell : We know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.

Olenna Tyrell : I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.

Brienne : My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment.

Olenna Tyrell : You dare not refuse.

Margaery Tyrell : A shadow?

Brienne : A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king.

Margaery Tyrell : Joffrey is our king now.

Brienne : I meant no offense.

Margaery Tyrell : And you've given none.

Jaime Lannister : All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace?

Joffrey Lannister : Yes, yes, one guard at the... the thing. Go on.

Jaime Lannister : Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.

Meryn : I've always guarded the king himself, my lord. Ever since your absence.

Jaime Lannister : And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don't expect any trouble.

Meryn : The people love their king. They know who keeps them fed.

Jaime Lannister : Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.

Joffrey Lannister : By my leave. They know I saved the city. They know I won the war.

Jaime Lannister : The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.

Joffrey Lannister : I broke Stannis on the Blackwater. Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle.

Jaime Lannister : My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy.

Joffrey Lannister : Busy getting captured.

Jaime Lannister : So this is the famous "Book of Brothers"? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man.

Jaime Lannister : So they say.

Joffrey Lannister : Ser Jaime Lannister.

Joffrey Lannister : Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.

Jaime Lannister : There's still time.

Joffrey Lannister : Is there? For a 40-year-old knight with one hand? How can you protect me with that?

Jaime Lannister : I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest.

Daenerys Targaryen : Have you ever been to Meereen?

Missandei : Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys.

Daenerys Targaryen : And?

Missandei : They say 1,000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen.

Daenerys Targaryen : And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried?

Missandei : If they're smart, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : You were told to ride at the back of the train.

Daario : Yes, my queen. But I need to speak to you about something important. A matter of strategy.

Missandei : Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : All right, what is this matter of strategy?

Daario : A dusk rose.

Daenerys Targaryen : Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?

Daario : And this one's called lady's lace.

Daenerys Targaryen : Would you like to walk without shoes?

Daario : You have to know a land to rule it. It's plants, it's rivers, it's roads, it's people. Dusk rose tea eases fever. Everyone in Meereen knows that. Especially the slaves who have to make the tea. If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world. Strategy.

Daario : Harpy's Gold. No tea from this one. Beautiful but poisonous.

Daenerys Targaryen : You are a gambler, aren't you?

Daario : Your Grace.

Jorah Mormont : There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.

Daenerys Targaryen : How many miles are there between here and Meereen?

Barristan : 163, Your Grace. I'll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them. You don't need to see this.

Daenerys Targaryen : You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her.

Brienne : There she is.

Jaime Lannister : Yes, there she is.

Brienne : And? You made a promise.

Jaime Lannister : To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.

Brienne : To keep them safe.

Jaime Lannister : Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication.

Brienne : A complication does not release you from a vow.

Jaime Lannister : What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?

Brienne : Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.

Jaime Lannister : Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks.

Ser Dontos : It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.

Sansa Stark : You're drunk.

Ser Dontos : Yes. I have good reason to be. Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool. Don't you know me?

Sansa Stark : Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.

Ser Dontos : I can't accept your apology. I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you.

Sansa Stark : Anyone would have done the same.

Ser Dontos : But only you did. I can never repay you. You gave me my life. But this, this is worth more than my life.

Ser Dontos : It belonged to my mother and her mother before her. House Hollard was strong once. House on the rise. That's all that's left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me.

Sansa Stark : I can't take it. It's very, very kind of you, but I can't.

Ser Dontos : I don't have anything else left. That's all. Take it. Wear it. Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world.

Sansa Stark : I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos.

Ser Dontos : Yeah.

Arya Stark : When am I going to get a horse of my own?

Sandor Clegane : The little lady wants a pony.

Arya Stark : The little lady wants away from your stench.

Sandor Clegane : Horses aren't easy to come by. Even if they were, you think I'm gonna put you on your own horse? Watch the only thing of value I've got in the world ride away?

Arya Stark : Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?

Sandor Clegane : No.

Arya Stark : You're not very smart, are you?

Sandor Clegane : I'm not a thief.

Arya Stark : You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?

Sandor Clegane : A man's got to have a code.

Arya Stark : You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.

Sandor Clegane : You've got an aunt in the Vale. Your rich Aunt Lysa. After I sell you to her, maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much.

Arya Stark : I'm hungry. You're hungry.

Sandor Clegane : Five horses, five men. More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach.

Arya Stark : I know him. The small one. His name is Polliver. He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.

Arya Stark : He killed Lommy.

Sandor Clegane : What the fuck's a Lommy?

Arya Stark : He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He's still got it.

Sandor Clegane : Got what?

Arya Stark : My sword Needle.

Sandor Clegane : Needle? Of course you named your sword.

Arya Stark : Lots of people name their swords.

Sandor Clegane : Lots of cunts.

Sandor Clegane : What are you... get back here.

Arya Stark : My brother gave me that sword.

Sandor Clegane : Get back here.

Arya Stark : He killed my friend.

Sandor Clegane : I don't care if he ate your friend. We're not going in there.

Man : Come on, give it up.

Man : Come here.

Man : Let's have a feel there.

Man : Leave it.

Innkeeper : Please, she's a good girl.

Polliver : Shut your mouth and pour us more ale and we may not take her with us when we're done with her.

Polliver : I know you.

Polliver : You're the Hound.

Polliver : Pour our new friend some ale. What brings you so far north?

Sandor Clegane : I could ask the same of you. What are you doing up here?

Polliver : Just keeping the king's peace.

Sandor Clegane : No need. The war's over.

Polliver : So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater. Robb Stark killed at the Twins. And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother. Meaning no offense.

Sandor Clegane : None taken.

Polliver : He's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he does. But torture, torture, torture, torture. You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs. Drains the fun right out of it. And what's life without a little fun?

Polliver : But I don't need to tell you that, eh?

Sandor Clegane : She's all right. I've had better.

Polliver : You know what? You should come with us. His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere. Gold, silver, more daughters. Always something if you know how to make them talk. And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing. You could do well for yourself. We certainly have been.

Sandor Clegane : I'm not going to King's Landing.

Polliver : Think about it. We could do whatever we like wherever we go. These are the king's colors. No one's standing in his way now. Which means no one's standing in ours.

Sandor Clegane : Fuck the king.

Polliver : When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail and run from the Battle of the Blackwater, I didn't believe it. But here you are.

Sandor Clegane : Here I am. Bring me one of those chickens.

Polliver : You got money to pay for it?

Sandor Clegane : You paid for it?

Polliver : No. But we're the king's men. So, you got money?

Sandor Clegane : Not a penny.

Sandor Clegane : I'll still take that chicken.

Polliver : Tell you what. We'll trade you. One of our little chickens for one of yours. Give us a go at your friend. Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.

Sandor Clegane : You're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty.

Sandor Clegane : Ah. And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens.

Polliver : You don't seem to understand the situation.

Sandor Clegane : I understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room.

Polliver : You lived your life for the king. You're gonna die for some chickens?

Sandor Clegane : Someone is.

Arya Stark : Something wrong with your leg, boy?

Polliver : What? What do you mean?

Arya Stark : Can you walk? I've got to carry you?

Polliver : Carry me?

Arya Stark : Fine little blade.

Arya Stark : Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.

Ramsay Bolton : Tansy! Tansy! Tansy!

Ramsay Bolton : Tansy! Tansy!

Ramsay Bolton : There you are.

Myranda : I can't see her, Ramsay.

Ramsay Bolton : Tansy!

Ramsay Bolton : If you make it out of the woods, you win! Run, Tansy, run!

Ramsay Bolton : Tansy.

Myranda : Where is she?

Ramsay Bolton : Tansy, Tansy, Tansy!

Ramsay Bolton : Good girls. Down, girls. Down. Well done. You, too.

Myranda : I only wounded her.

Ramsay Bolton : You brought her down. That's what matters. A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?

Theon Greyjoy : A fine shot, master. My lady.

Tansy : Please, my lord. It hurts.

Ramsay Bolton : Oh, sweet. Don't cry. It will be over soon.

Myranda : She thinks she's pretty. Let me put one through her face.

Ramsay Bolton : We have to reward the hounds, love. They did all the hard work.

Tansy : Why? I did whatever you asked.

Ramsay Bolton : But you made Myranda feel jealous.

Myranda : Me jealous of her?

Tansy : My lord, please.

Ramsay Bolton : You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.

Ramsay Bolton : Rip her! Rip her! Rip her!

Ramsay Bolton : Not so pretty now.

Tyrion Lannister : Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?

Podrick : Is it solid gold?

Jaime Lannister : Gilded steel.

Tyrion Lannister : You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.

Jaime Lannister : I'm not hungry.

Tyrion Lannister : You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her.

Tyrion Lannister : A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness.

Jaime Lannister : Oh!

Podrick : I'll clean it up.

Jaime Lannister : No, I'll do it. Leave us.

Tyrion Lannister : It's only wine.

Jaime Lannister : I can't fight anymore.

Tyrion Lannister : What about your left?

Jaime Lannister : I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?

Tyrion Lannister : You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?

Jaime Lannister : I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...

Tyrion Lannister : Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand.

Jaime Lannister : With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone.

Tyrion Lannister : You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one.

Jaime Lannister : My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.

Bronn : He tells me you shit gold just like your father.

Jaime Lannister : Is this place safe?

Bronn : There's this knight, Leygood, got thunderbolts on his shield.

Jaime Lannister : Uh-huh.

Bronn : Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us.

Bronn : I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to.

Bronn : And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me.

Jaime Lannister : I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.

Jaime Lannister : Ah! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guardo s down.

Bronn : Best time to attack a man.

Bronn : Mind yourself. JAIME; If I still had my right hand...

Bronn : Plan on growing it back?

Jaime Lannister : Come on, then.

Man : Open the gates!

Man : Riders coming in! Let's get these horses seen to!

Ramsay Bolton : Father. Welcome home.

Roose : Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard.

Ramsay Bolton : A pleasure, Mother.

Walda : Hello.

Roose : See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down. And take Lady Walda to her chambers.

Woman : This way, my lady.

Roose : Where is your prize?

Ramsay Bolton : With the hounds. I'll have a look at him.

Ramsay Bolton : I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.

Locke : Word travels. How he screamed. You would have loved it.

Ramsay Bolton : Father.

Roose : What did you do to him?

Ramsay Bolton : I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned.

Roose : You flayed him.

Ramsay Bolton : Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others.

Roose : This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.

Ramsay Bolton : We've been flaying our enemies for a thousand years. The flayed man is on our banners.

Roose : My banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North. But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the Ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin.

Ramsay Bolton : I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no-

Roose : You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?

Ramsay Bolton : You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.

Roose : I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.

Ramsay Bolton : Theon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us.

Roose : I placed far too much trust in you.

Ramsay Bolton : Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm sorry, my lord.

Ramsay Bolton : Give him the razor.

Ramsay Bolton : If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?

Ramsay Bolton : Go on, Reek. A nice close shave.

Ramsay Bolton : Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?

Theon Greyjoy : I don't know, my lord.

Roose : You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.

Ramsay Bolton : Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?

Theon Greyjoy : No, my lord. Just two farm boys.

Ramsay Bolton : And crisped them so no one would know.

Theon Greyjoy : Yes, my lord.

Ramsay Bolton : The Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone.

Ramsay Bolton : Oh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that?

Roose : You ready for a hunt?

Meryn Trant : Always. Find those boys and I'll give you a thousand acres and a holdfast.

Locke : Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?

Theon Greyjoy : Jon Snow is at Castle Black.

Locke : Who the fuck is Jon Snow?

Roose : Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.

Ramsay Bolton : Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat.

Roose : You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position.

Tyrion Lannister : Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?

Varys : I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, to be foreign.

Varys : Ahem.

Varys : Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears.

Tyrion Lannister : So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.

Varys : No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear.

Tyrion Lannister : Forgive me if I don't weep for you.

Varys : No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.

Tyrion Lannister : She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it.

Varys : Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?

Mace : From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach, Your Grace, it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup.

Mace : May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long.

Joffrey Lannister : A handsome goblet, my lord. Or shall I call you Father?

Mace : I shall be honored, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : She's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one.

Tywin Lannister : Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.

Joffrey Lannister : A book?

Tyrion Lannister : The Lives of Four Kings." Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read.

Joffrey Lannister : Now that the war is won, we should all find time for wisdom. Thank you, Uncle.

Tywin Lannister : One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor.

Pycelle : Careful, Your Grace. Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.

Joffrey Lannister : So they say.

Joffrey Lannister : Such a great sword should have a name. What shall I call her?

Man : Stormbringer.

Man : Terminus.

Man : Widow's Wail.

Man : Wolfsbane.

Joffrey Lannister : Widow's Wail. I like that. Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off Ned Stark's head all over again.

Tyrion Lannister : Don't.

Shae : You want me on the desk? What's wrong, my lion?

Tyrion Lannister : Don't call me that.

Shae : What should I call you?

Tyrion Lannister : I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.

Shae : Our friendship?

Tyrion Lannister : There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.

Shae : What?

Tyrion Lannister : You'll have your own cabin, of course, and, across the Narrow Sea, a house, servants.

Shae : What is this?

Tyrion Lannister : I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows.

Shae : She doesn't want you.

Tyrion Lannister : I need to do right by her.

Shae : You don't want her.

Tyrion Lannister : By our children.

Shae : What are you afraid of?

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not afraid.

Shae : You are. You are afraid of your father and your sister. You're going to run from them all your life?

Tyrion Lannister : I need you to leave.

Shae : I'm not afraid of them. I'm not going to run.

Tyrion Lannister : Shae.

Shae : We will fight them together. It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine.

Tyrion Lannister : You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? Five hundred? Five thousand?

Shae : How many whores have you been with?

Tyrion Lannister : I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.

Tyrion Lannister : You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.

Melisandre : Hear us now. Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness.

Axell Florent : Sire, I served you well.

Melisandre : Lord of Light, show us the way...

Axell Florent : Selyse, you're my sister!

Selyse : Yours are the stars that guide us.

Axell Florent : Tell him! Tell him!

Melisandre : Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors.

Selyse : Did you see? Their souls. It was their souls. Our lord took them. Did you see?

Davos : Lord Florent was your brother by law.

Stannis Baratheon : He was an infidel.

Davos : He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him. They were the gods of your fathers, too.

Stannis Baratheon : I ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed.

Davos : How many ships did he bring to your 'cause? How many men?

Stannis Baratheon : A good deal more than you.

Selyse : Did you see, Ser Davos? They're with our lord now. Their sins all burned away. Did you see?

Davos : I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen.

Stannis Baratheon : Meat's off.

Selyse : Our larders are almost empty.

Stannis Baratheon : Serve fish, then. We're on an island.

Selyse : You hate fish.

Stannis Baratheon : I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same.

Selyse : When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books. The binding glue is made from horses. One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull. Do you remember?

Stannis Baratheon : Of course I remember.

Selyse : Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?

Melisandre : It's all I knew when I was a child.

Selyse : Until you found the Lord of Light?

Melisandre : Until he found me.

Selyse : I fear for our daughter's soul.

Melisandre : Every mother should fear for her childo s soul.

Selyse : She's a stubborn little beast.

Stannis Baratheon : She's a child.

Selyse : You barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.

Stannis Baratheon : She's my daughter. You will not strike her.

Selyse : As you command. Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.

Shireen : Come in.

Melisandre : Were you sleeping, Princess?

Melisandre : Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?

Shireen : I heard it.

Melisandre : And it frightened you?

Shireen : Ser Axell was my uncle. He was always kind to me.

Melisandre : They're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world.

Shireen : But they screamed.

Melisandre : Women scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy.

Shireen : Afterward they aren't ash and bone.

Melisandre : You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess.

Shireen : And you didn't have this.

Melisandre : No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?

Shireen : I read "The Seven-Pointed Star."

Melisandre : Lies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two... a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war.

Shireen : There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?

Melisandre : There's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now.

Hodor : Hodor.

Bran Stark : Why did you wake me?

Meera : You've been gone for hours.

Bran Stark : I was hungry.

Meera : We're all hungry.

Bran Stark : I was just eating.

Jojen : Summer was eating. Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes. Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous. You're not a direwolf, Bran.

Jojen : Must be glorious, though. To run, to leap, to hunt. To be whole. I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human.

Meera : You'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you. And if we lose you, we lose everything.

Bran Stark : Hodor, take me to the tree.

Threeeyed Raven : Look for me... beneath the tree.

Cersei Lannister : He saw us.

Threeeyed Raven : North.

Bran Stark : I know where we have to go.

Septon : Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul. Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder.

Joffrey Lannister : With this kiss, I pledge my love.

Sansa Stark : We have a new queen.

Tyrion Lannister : Better her than you.

Tywin Lannister : Bit much, wouldn't you say?

Olenna Tyrell : It feels proportionate.

Tywin Lannister : Proportionate to what?

Olenna Tyrell : The expected extravagance.

Tywin Lannister : People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.

Olenna Tyrell : You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.

Olenna Tyrell : Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking.

Olenna Tyrell : Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share.

Tywin Lannister : Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?

Olenna Tyrell : No, your heartfelt thank you is its own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. "The Iron Bank will have it's due." How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts.

Tywin Lannister : I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.

Olenna Tyrell : We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love.

Bronn : All taken care of.

Tyrion Lannister : You saw her board the ship?

Bronn : Aye, she's on it.

Tyrion Lannister : You saw the ship sail away?

Bronn : No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys.

Tyrion Lannister : How do you know?

Bronn : Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow.

Tyrion Lannister : There's someone following you?

Bronn : She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing.

Oberyn Martell : Hello.

Tyrion Lannister : Hello.

Oberyn Martell : Not you.

Olenna Tyrell : You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage.

Tyrion Lannister : My lady. My lady.

Olenna Tyrell : Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for.

Musician : A coat of gold / Or a coat of red / A lion still has claws And mine, my lord...

Joffrey Lannister : Very good. Very good. Off you go.

Margaery Tyrell : My love, why don't we make the announcement?

Joffrey Lannister : Everyone. The queen would like to say a few words.

Margaery Tyrell : We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink. Not all among us are so lucky. To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city.

Cersei Lannister : You're an example to us all.

Loras : Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry.

Jaime Lannister : Ser Loras, it's quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful.

Loras : As does yours.

Jaime Lannister : So, looking forward to your wedding?

Loras : Yes, very much.

Jaime Lannister : Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.

Loras : They certainly are.

Jaime Lannister : Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her.

Loras : And neither will you.

Brienne : Your Grace. My king. My queen.

Margaery Tyrell : Lady Brienne. So good of you to come.

Brienne : I'm no lady, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : Did you just bow?

Brienne : Apologies, Your Grace. I never did master the curtsy.

Joffrey Lannister : You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.

Margaery Tyrell : That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it.

Joffrey Lannister : A shame. I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.

Brienne : I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune. The country has been at war too long. I hope your reign is long and peaceful.

Joffrey Lannister : Yes, yes.

Margaery Tyrell : Thank you. I hope we see more of you.

Cersei Lannister : Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.

Brienne : As you say, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.

Brienne : In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once.

Cersei Lannister : Did he? Haven't heard that story before.

Brienne : Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid.

Cersei Lannister : I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.

Brienne : I don't serve your brother, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : But you love him.

Brienne : Your Grace.

Pycelle : No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally.

Cersei Lannister : She'll do no such thing.

Pycelle : Oh, Your Grace. Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice...

Cersei Lannister : You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.

Maid : Your Grace.

Pycelle : Qyburn? Deplorable man. Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.

Cersei Lannister : More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?

Pycelle : Your Grace, I am a man of learning.

Cersei Lannister : My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?

Pycelle : I never meant to annoy anyone.

Cersei Lannister : But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.

Pycelle : Your Grace, Queen Margaery-

Cersei Lannister : The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.

Joffrey Lannister : A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.

Tywin Lannister : You're in rather a good mood.

Cersei Lannister : I suppose I am.

Tywin Lannister : I won't ask why.

Cersei Lannister : Small pleasures.

Oberyn Martell : Your Grace. Lord Tywin.

Tywin Lannister : Prince Oberyn.

Oberyn Martell : I don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand.

Ellaria : My lord. My lady.

Tywin Lannister : Charmed.

Cersei Lannister : Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.

Ellaria : We are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters.

Oberyn Martell : Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne.

Cersei Lannister : No? How tolerant of you.

Oberyn Martell : I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked.

Cersei Lannister : I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.

Tywin Lannister : Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again.

Oberyn Martell : They call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it.

Tywin Lannister : Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.

Oberyn Martell : People everywhere have their differences. In some places, the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places, the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place.

Joffrey Lannister : Everyone, silence! Clear the floor. There's been too much amusement here today. A royal wedding is not an amusement. A royal wedding is history. The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history. My lords... my ladies...

Joffrey Lannister : I give you. King Joffrey... Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy. The War of the Five Kings.

Renly Dwarf : I'm the rightful king.

Robb Dwarf : King in the North!

Joffrey Dwarf : Yes!

Balon Dwarf : Traitor. You're a traitor.

Joffrey Dwarf : For the Seven Kingdoms!

Joffrey Dwarf : Let the war begin.

Stannis Dwarf : Renly, you're no king.

Balon Dwarf : Away, degenerate. Away. Away.

Renly Dwarf : Ooh, careful.

Stannis Dwarf : Go on.

Renly Dwarf : I want you to be my prince. Stannis!

Balon Dwarf : Who's got the gold now, Stark?

Robb Dwarf : I am the rightful king.

Balon Dwarf : Challenge me, ruffian.

Robb Dwarf : Take that.

Balon Dwarf : I'm drowning. I'm drowning.

Robb Dwarf : I am the King in the North!

Stannis Dwarf : Not wildfire!

Tyrion Lannister : Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.

Podrick : Yes, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : We'll have to find another way to thank the king.

Joffrey Dwarf : Charge!

Joffrey Dwarf : Ready, again.

Robb Dwarf : I am the King in the North! - Charge!

Joffrey Dwarf : Charge! Yes!

Joffrey Dwarf : Your head!

Joffrey Dwarf : Fine gentlemen.

Joffrey Lannister : Well fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle. How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume.

Tyrion Lannister : One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night.

Tyrion Lannister : A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.

Joffrey Lannister : It did not spill.

Margaery Tyrell : My love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast.

Joffrey Lannister : Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cup-bearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace does me a great honor.

Joffrey Lannister : It's not meant as an honor.

Joffrey Lannister : Bring me my goblet.

Joffrey Lannister : What good is an empty cup? Fill it.

Joffrey Lannister : Kneel. Kneel before your king.

Joffrey Lannister : Kneel. I said... kneel!

Margaery Tyrell : Look, the pie.

Joffrey Lannister : My queen.

Margaery Tyrell : Wonderful. Wonderful. My hero.

Sansa Stark : Can we leave now?

Tyrion Lannister : Let's find out.

Joffrey Lannister : Uncle. Where are you going? You're my cup-bearer, remember?

Tyrion Lannister : I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace.

Joffrey Lannister : No, no, no. No, you're perfect the way you are. Serve me my wine.

Joffrey Lannister : Well, hurry up. This pie is dry.

Joffrey Lannister : Mm, good. Needs washing down.

Tyrion Lannister : If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired.

Joffrey Lannister : No. No, you'll wait here... un...

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace?

Joffrey Lannister : It's nothing.

Margaery Tyrell : He's choking!

Olenna Tyrell : Help the poor boy.

Olenna Tyrell : Idiots, help your king.

Jaime Lannister : Move away!

Jaime Lannister : Joffrey! Joffrey!

Cersei Lannister : Help him! Someone help him!

Cersei Lannister : Joffrey!

Ser Dontos : Come with me now.

Cersei Lannister : Joffrey! Joffrey!

Ser Dontos : If you want to live, we have to leave.

Cersei Lannister : Don't touch him!

Cersei Lannister : Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!

Cersei Lannister : My son.

Man : He's gone. Our king is gone.

Cersei Lannister : He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him!

Cersei Lannister : You did this. You did this!

Ser Dontos : We have to leave.

Cersei Lannister : Take him! Take him!

Cersei Lannister : Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?

Tywin Lannister : Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.

Cersei Lannister : Where is she?!

Tywin Lannister : No one leaves the capital! No one!

Ser Dontos : Get in.

Sansa Stark : Where are we going?

Ser Dontos : Somewhere safe.

Ser Dontos : Up you go, my lady. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you know.

Sansa Stark : Lord Baelish?

Petyr Baelish : Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?

Petyr Baelish : Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past. Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.

Ser Dontos : Lord Baelish. I promised I'd get her to you safely.

Petyr Baelish : Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water.

Ser Dontos : I should get back before someone thinks to look for me. LITTLEFINGER First you'll want your pay. 10,000 was it?

Ser Dontos : 10000

Ser Dontos : Wait!

Petyr Baelish : Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?

Sansa Stark : I didn't murder anyone.

Petyr Baelish : I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder.

Sansa Stark : Why did you kill him?

Petyr Baelish : Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.

Sansa Stark : He saved me.

Petyr Baelish : Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever.

Sansa Stark : He was helping me because I saved his life.

Petyr Baelish : Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard.

Petyr Baelish : I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?

Sansa Stark : We're all liars here.

Petyr Baelish : Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home.

Margaery Tyrell : So am I the queen?

Olenna Tyrell : More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue.

Margaery Tyrell : Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible.

Olenna Tyrell : The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it.

Margaery Tyrell : What was it like?

Olenna Tyrell : They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.

Margaery Tyrell : One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.

Olenna Tyrell : Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that.

Margaery Tyrell : But I would have been the queen.

Olenna Tyrell : Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.

Tywin Lannister : Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?

Tywin Lannister : I'm not trying to trick you.

Tommen Lannister : It means I'll become king.

Tywin Lannister : Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?

Tommen Lannister : A good king?

Tywin Lannister : Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?

Cersei Lannister : This is hardly the place or the time.

Tommen Lannister : Holiness?

Tywin Lannister : Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.

Tommen Lannister : Justice.

Tywin Lannister : Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?

Tommen Lannister : No.

Tywin Lannister : No.

Tommen Lannister : What about strength?

Tywin Lannister : Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?

Tommen Lannister : Wisdom.

Tywin Lannister : Yes!

Tommen Lannister : Wisdom is what makes a good king.

Tywin Lannister : Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?

Tywin Lannister : No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?

Tommen Lannister : A king needs a queen.

Tywin Lannister : Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?

Tommen Lannister : Yes.

Tywin Lannister : Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?

Tommen Lannister : I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.

Jaime Lannister : How are you?

Tommen Lannister : I'm all right.

Jaime Lannister : You are. You will be. I'll see to that.

Jaime Lannister : Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.

Septon : Yes, my lord. All of you.

Cersei Lannister : It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. "A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth." That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he...

Jaime Lannister : I don't know what I saw.

Cersei Lannister : Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.

Jaime Lannister : Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.

Cersei Lannister : I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy.

Jaime Lannister : You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?

Cersei Lannister : Jaime, not here, please. Please.

Cersei Lannister : Stop it. Stop it. Stop.

Jaime Lannister : No.

Cersei Lannister : Stop it. Stop.

Cersei Lannister : Stop. Stop. It's not right.

Cersei Lannister : It's not right. It's not right.

Jaime Lannister : I don't care.

Cersei Lannister : Don't.

Cersei Lannister : Don't. Jaime, don't.

Arya Stark : Gonna rain soon. Where are we?

Sandor Clegane : Near Fairmarket, I think.

Arya Stark : You think? You don't have a map?

Sandor Clegane : No, I don't have a map.

Arya Stark : Maybe we should get one.

Sandor Clegane : Just point out the next map shop you see and I'll buy you one.

Arya Stark : How far is it to the Eyrie?

Sandor Clegane : Far.

Arya Stark : And you're sure we're going the right way?

Sandor Clegane : Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can. Get my gold, be on my way.

Arya Stark : On your way where?

Sandor Clegane : Why do you care? Might book passage across the Narrow Sea. Fight as a sellsword. Second Sons, could be. Seems like a good fit for me.

Arya Stark : I'd like to see Braavos one day.

Sandor Clegane : Why Braavos?

Arya Stark : I have friends there.

Sandor Clegane : I doubt it.

Farmer Hamlet : Seven blessings to you.

Sandor Clegane : What do you want?

Farmer Hamlet : What do I want? This is my land.

Sandor Clegane : If I'm standing on it, it's my land.

Arya Stark : We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.

Arya Stark : He's never been the same.

Farmer Hamlet : Which house did he fight for?

Arya Stark : The Tullys of Riverrun.

Farmer Hamlet : There's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight. There's fresh hay in the barn. And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do. We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it.

Farmer Hamlet : We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.

Sandor Clegane : You got to do all seven of the fuckers?

Arya Stark : Father!

Farmer Hamlet : We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us. We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.

Sandor Clegane : And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.

Arya Stark : I'm so sorry.

Arya Stark : Really good.

Farmer Hamlet : Did you fight at the Twins?

Sandor Clegane : Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.

Farmer Hamlet : The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.

Sandor Clegane : Guest right don't mean much anymore.

Farmer Hamlet : It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour.

Sandor Clegane : You got any ale?

Farmer Hamlet : Afraid not.

Sandor Clegane : How can a man not keep ale in his home?

Farmer Hamlet : You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense.

Sandor Clegane : What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?

Sandor Clegane : Fair wages for fair work.

Arya Stark : What did you do?!

Sandor Clegane : Get your horse saddled.

Arya Stark : You told me you weren't a thief.

Sandor Clegane : I wasn't.

Arya Stark : He took us in. He fed us and you...

Sandor Clegane : Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter.

Arya Stark : You don't know that.

Sandor Clegane : I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.

Arya Stark : You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.

Sandor Clegane : There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?

Ranger : Raper. Raper. Horse thief. Ninth born son. Raper. Thief. Thief and raper.

Alliser Thorne : There he is, Sam the Slayer.

Janos Slynt : Going to visit your wildling whore?

Sam : She's not a whore.

Janos Slynt : No? Maybe I'll give her a copper tonight and find out.

Sam : They all think I'm lying.

Gilly : About what?

Sam : Killing the white Walker.

Gilly : You're not lying. I'll never forget the way it screamed.

Sam : But you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a...

Gilly : A what?

Sam : Well, a wildling.

Gilly : My father hated that word.

Sam : It's not a very nice word, I suppose.

Gilly : I don't know. It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?

Sam : So... are you all right? No one bothering you?

Gilly : I get a lot of looks. I hear them making their jokes. But no one's touched me if that's what you mean.

Sam : I worry about it sometimes. All the time.

Gilly : Why do you worry about it?

Sam : 100 men, one woman.

Gilly : They've got other things to think about.

Sam : That's the only thing they think about.

Gilly : You're being silly.

Sam : I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.

Gilly : What about you?

Sam : What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.

Gilly : Thank you.

Sam : For what?

Gilly : For worrying about me.

Sam : I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep.

Gilly : So what are you saying?

Sam : Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.

Gilly : Are you bored of me?

Sam : Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.

Gilly : I'll get these to Hobb. Keep an eye on little Sam.

Davos : Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?

Davos : Joffrey?

Stannis Baratheon : The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.

Davos : I will find you an army, Your Grace. I've been working day and night...

Stannis Baratheon : What progress have you made?

Davos : I've rallied House Peasebury to your 'cause.

Stannis Baratheon : House Peasebury.

Davos : House Musgood.

Stannis Baratheon : House Musgood.

Davos : And House Haigh.

Stannis Baratheon : House Haigh. They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.

Davos : Westeros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company.

Stannis Baratheon : The Golden Company?

Davos : They've never broken a contract.

Stannis Baratheon : They're sellswords.

Davos : We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground.

Stannis Baratheon : We don't have any gold.

Davos : Not yet.

Stannis Baratheon : If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time. -

Shireen : You're late.

Davos : I'm sorry, Princess.

Shireen : I thought you weren't coming.

Davos : The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.

Shireen : You won't be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

Davos : That happened once, weeks ago. You're your father's daughter, no mistake. Bloody relentless, the both of you.

Shireen : It's a new one today. Lots of tricky words. But I think you can manage.

Shireen : You'll never read well if you move your lips. That's how children do it.

Davos : The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas. First Sword of Braavos.

Davos : Thank you very much.

Shireen : I like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates. You were a pirate once.

Davos : No, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler.

Shireen : What's the difference?

Davos : Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right.

Shireen : My father says a criminal is a criminal.

Davos : Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.

Shireen : You've sailed to Braavos?

Davos : Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction...

Shireen : What was that for?

Davos : I need you to write a message.

Shireen : You should write it yourself. It's good practice.

Davos : It's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on.

Davos : To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.

Shireen : But that's not you.

Davos : I need to get their attention. Go on. Write.

Sam : He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?

Moles Town Whore : Precious little thing.

Moles Town Whore : What's his name?

Gilly : Sam.

Moles Town Whore : Lovely. That the daddy?

Gilly : No.

Moles Town Whore : Where's the daddy?

Gilly : He's dead.

Moles Town Whore : Oh. Where you from?

Gilly : North of here.

Moles Town Whore : North of here? You a fucking wildling?

Moles Town Madam : Only room and board?

Sam : That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.

Moles Town Madam : Could find other work for her, too.

Sam : No other work.

Moles Town Madam : There'd be money. Give you a piece of it.

Sam : I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?

Gilly : You protected me north of the Wall.

Sam : This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's.

Sam : You have to trust me. It's for the best.

Gilly : Best for you.

Sam : Oh, Gilly. Please don't.

Oberyn Martell : Greedy.

Ellaria : No?

Olyvar : I'm sorry. You're lovely, I just never acquired the taste.

Oberyn Martell : You're calling my beauty an acquired taste?

Ellaria : That's quite all right, lover. It's more for you.

Oberyn Martell : Your loss.

Olyvar : You like them both the same? Boys and girls?

Oberyn Martell : Does that surprise you?

Olyvar : Everyone has a preference.

Oberyn Martell : Then everyone is missing half the worldo s pleasure. The gods made that and it delights me. The gods made this and it delights me. When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne. When it comes to love, I don't choose sides.

Olyvar : I hope I have as much stamina when I'm your age.

Oberyn Martell : What are you, 25?

Ellaria : Children.

Oberyn Martell : Someday, if you're lucky, you will wake up and realize you are old. That pretty ass of yours will sag. Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears. No one will want you anymore. Make sure you fucked your fill before that day.

Olyvar : Did you?

Ellaria : He is a prince of Dorne. Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.

Oberyn Martell : They will all have to line up behind you.

Tywin Lannister : Prince Oberyn.

Oberyn Martell : Lord Tywin.

Tywin Lannister : May we have the room?

Ellaria : Call my name if you need me, lover.

Oberyn Martell : Would you like to sit?

Tywin Lannister : No, thank you.

Oberyn Martell : Some wine?

Oberyn Martell : I'm sorry about your grandson.

Tywin Lannister : Are you?

Oberyn Martell : I don't believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father. Or his grandfather. An awful way to die.

Tywin Lannister : Which way is that?

Oberyn Martell : Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?

Tywin Lannister : Some believe the king choked.

Oberyn Martell : Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant. The king was poisoned.

Tywin Lannister : I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.

Oberyn Martell : I did. This is why I know.

Tywin Lannister : Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning.

Oberyn Martell : Rather suspicious. Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?

Tywin Lannister : You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?

Oberyn Martell : You think we conspired together?

Tywin Lannister : What did you discuss?

Oberyn Martell : The death of my sister.

Tywin Lannister : For which you blame me.

Oberyn Martell : She was raped and murdered by the Mountain. The Mountain follows your orders. Of course I blame you.

Tywin Lannister : Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?

Oberyn Martell : You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that. I am a man of reason. If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.

Tywin Lannister : Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.

Oberyn Martell : So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?

Tywin Lannister : Categorically.

Oberyn Martell : I would like to speak with the Mountain.

Tywin Lannister : I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.

Oberyn Martell : He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.

Tywin Lannister : I could arrange for this meeting.

Oberyn Martell : But you want something in return.

Tywin Lannister : There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third.

Oberyn Martell : Why?

Tywin Lannister : Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies.

Oberyn Martell : Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen. Asking me to judge at your son's trial isn't quite as tempting.

Tywin Lannister : I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.

Oberyn Martell : I never realized you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

Tywin Lannister : We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

Oberyn Martell : You're saying you need us? That must be hard for you to admit.

Tywin Lannister : We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.

Tyrion Lannister : Podrick. Apologies for the stench.

Podrick : I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me.

Tyrion Lannister : A noble effort.

Podrick : They didn't find the candles, though. A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese.

Tyrion Lannister : You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?

Podrick : I've heard nothing, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?

Podrick : You're to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?

Podrick : No, my lord. You didn't?

Tyrion Lannister : No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?

Podrick : Your father.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course.

Podrick : Mace Tyrell.

Tyrion Lannister : Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.

Podrick : And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.

Tyrion Lannister : Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.

Podrick : I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa.

Podrick : My lord, she's gone.

Tyrion Lannister : Gone?

Podrick : No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...

Tyrion Lannister : No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick.

Podrick : Yes, my lord?

Tyrion Lannister : They'll be following you now.

Podrick : Who will?

Tyrion Lannister : I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go.

Podrick : Any other witnesses, my lord?

Tyrion Lannister : Varys could vouch for me if he dared.

Podrick : He's already been called as a witness for the queen.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.

Podrick : I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you.

Tyrion Lannister : Why not?

Podrick : They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.

Tyrion Lannister : And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?

Podrick : I'll ask, my lord.

Podrick : There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler.

Tyrion Lannister : Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?

Podrick : I didn't tell them anything, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Are you going to accept their offer?

Podrick : My lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet.

Podrick : You've been good to me, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that.

Podrick : I already gave them an answer, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted.

Tyrion Lannister : Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell.

Podrick : Farewell, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.

Olly : Mother says it's time to eat.

Guymon : What's she got boiling? Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

Olly : Potatoes.

Guymon : Potatoes. Well, no one boils a potato better than your mom. Has she got...

Man : The wildlings!

Ollys Mother : Guymon! Hide. Hide!

Styr : You know how to get to Castle Black?

Olly : Yes. Yes.

Styr : Those your parents? Open your eyes. I'm going to eat them. Do you hear me? I'm going to eat your dead mama and I'm going to eat your dead papa. Go tell the crows at Castle Black.

Yarwyck : We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.

Men : Aye! Aye!

Yarwyck : Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall. Seems like that would be a good lesson.

Men : Aye!

Alliser Thorne : If we go after them, we'll be giving them what they want. They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time.

Maester Aemon : We have just over 100 men. And that's including stewards and builders. And me. We can't afford to lose a single man. We must remember our first responsibility. We are the watchers on the Wall.

Pyp : There's got to be a way to protect them.

Alliser Thorne : You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow. What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?

Jon Snow : Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them.

Alliser Thorne : We need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall. That is our job.

Pyp : Rangers returning.

Jon Snow : Help him.

Dolorous Edd : Thought you'd have blue eyes by now.

Alliser Thorn : What took you so long?

Grenn : We were held up.

Alliser Thorn : By what?

Grenn : Chains.

Dolorous Edd : We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.

Jon Snow : And the mutineers stayed?

Dolorous Edd : They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.

Jon Snow : We need to ride north and kill them all.

Alliser Thorn : We just went over this, boy. -Justice can wait.

Jon Snow : It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them.

Pyp : I don't think I can kill 100 wildlings.

Daenerys Targaryen : Are they attacking?

Jorah Mormont : A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.

Daenerys Targaryen : What is he doing?

Barristan Selmy : I believe he means to...

Missandei : He says that we're an army of men without man parts. He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who... hides his cock in his own asshole.

Barristan Selmy : Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words.

Jorah Mormont : They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.

Daenerys Targaryen : I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?

Grey Worm : Allow me this honor, mother of dragons. I will not disappoint you.

Daenerys Targaryen : You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.

Barristan Selmy : Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive.

Daenerys Targaryen : Which is why you must remain by my side.

Jorah Mormont : I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well.

Daenerys Targaryen : You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life.

Daario : I was the last to join your army. I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied. My mother was a whore. I come from nothing. And before long, I will return to nothing. Let me kill this man for you.

Daenerys Targaryen : Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while.

Missandei : He is very brave, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching.

Daenerys Targaryen : You sure you don't want a horse?

Daario : Why would I want a horse?

Daenerys Targaryen : Horses are faster than men.

Daario : Horses are dumber than men.

Daenerys Targaryen : I am Daenerys Stormborn.

Daenerys Targaryen : Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you.

Daenerys Targaryen : Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward!

Daenerys Targaryen : Fire!

Grey Worm : My name is Grey Worm. I come from the Summer "Ills."

Missandei : Isles. Summer Isles.

Grey Worm : Summer Isles.

Missandei : I am from an island called Naath.

Grey Worm : When they took you?

Missandei : When did they take me?" I was five years old.

Grey Worm : You remember your home?

Missandei : I remember when they rowed us away from shore. How white the beaches were. How tall the trees. And I remember my village burning. Smoke rising into the sky. Do you remember your home?

Grey Worm : Unsullied. Always Unsullied. Before Unsullied, nothing.

Missandei : That's not true. Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.

Grey Worm : I don't want return.

Missandei : Kill the masters.

Grey Worm : Kill the masters.

Daenerys Targaryen : How are the lessons coming?

Missandei : Very well, Your Grace.

Grey Worm : Missandei is teacher good, my queen.

Daenerys Targaryen : You'll have to continue later. It's time.

Mossador : You heard her! She said she came to free us.

Elder Meereen Slave : You are a fool. The masters are too strong.

Mossador : She will protect us. She defeated the masters' champion.

Mossador : She has a great army. You want to live the rest of your days in chains?

Meereen Slave : I want to live. You saw what they did to those children. What do you think they'll do to us?

Elder Meereen Slave : I've been through two slave revolts, boy. They always end the same way

Grey Worm : All men must die.

Grey Worm : But I promise you, a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains.

Elder Meereen Slave : Who are you?

Grey Worm : This one is called Grey Worm. I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor, raised and trained as Unsullied. Now I fight for Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains.

Elder Meereen Slave : You are Unsullied? They taught you how to fight before you could walk. We are not soldiers.

Meereen Slave : We have no training, weapons.

Grey Worm : There are three slaves in this city for every Master. No one can give you your freedom, brothers. If you want it, you must take it.

Slaves : Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

Slaves : Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

Slaves : Mhysa! Mhysa!

Daenerys Targaryen : Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?

Jorah Mormont : 163, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : Yes, that was it.

Barristan Selmy : Your Grace, may I have a word? The city is yours. All these people,they're your subjects now. Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.

Daenerys Targaryen : I will answer injustice with justice.

Jaime Lannister : What the hell was that?

Bronn : That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.

Jaime Lannister : You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway.

Bronn : You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?

Jaime Lannister : You talk to my brother this way?

Bronn : All the time. He got used to it.

Jaime Lannister : Do you think he did it?

Bronn : No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?

Bronn : You haven't been to see him yet, eh?

Jaime Lannister : We're done for today.

Bronn : Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?

Jaime Lannister : You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.

Bronn : Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?

Jaime Lannister : To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months.

Tyrion Lannister : Is that supposed to make me feel better?

Jaime Lannister : Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.

Tyrion Lannister : It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?

Jaime Lannister : How do you think? Her son died in her arms.

Tyrion Lannister : Her son?

Jaime Lannister : Don't. You know what's coming?

Tyrion Lannister : My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.

Jaime Lannister : Now that you mention it, she did ask.

Tyrion Lannister : So, should I turn around and close my eyes?

Jaime Lannister : Depends. Did you do it?

Tyrion Lannister : The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?

Jaime Lannister : Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?

Tyrion Lannister : Well, you could set me free.

Jaime Lannister : You know I can't.

Tyrion Lannister : Then there's really nothing else to say.

Jaime Lannister : What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

Tyrion Lannister : Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate.

Jaime Lannister : Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.

Tyrion Lannister : Except I didn't do it.

Jaime Lannister : Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my heado s on a spike.

Jaime Lannister : Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.

Tyrion Lannister : Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?

Tyrion Lannister : No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway.

Sansa Stark : Where are you taking me?

Petyr Baelish : I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.

Sansa Stark : Did you kill Joffrey?

Petyr Baelish : Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.

Sansa Stark : I know it was you.

Petyr Baelish : And who helped me with this conspiracy?

Sansa Stark : Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king.

Petyr Baelish : Why not?

Sansa Stark : Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.

Petyr Baelish : Then perhaps it was your husband.

Sansa Stark : No.

Petyr Baelish : How do you know?

Sansa Stark : I just do.

Petyr Baelish : You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.

Sansa Stark : The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.

Petyr Baelish : A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.

Sansa Stark : I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?

Petyr Baelish : So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.

Sansa Stark : And what do you want?

Petyr Baelish : Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?

Sansa Stark : Who could trust you?

Petyr Baelish : I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong.

Margaery Tyrell : I can't believe you're going. Leaving me alone here with these people.

Olenna Tyrell : The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs.

Olenna Tyrell : Have you been to see Tommen yet?

Margaery Tyrell : No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.

Olenna Tyrell : I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber.

Olenna Tyrell : How absentminded of me.

Margaery Tyrell : Mm-hmm.

Olenna Tyrell : The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.

Olenna Tyrell : And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit.

Margaery Tyrell : Well, he could have done.

Olenna Tyrell : He could have done,but he didn't.

Margaery Tyrell : You don't know, Grandmother.

Olenna Tyrell : But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?

Margaery Tyrell : What? I don't understand.

Olenna Tyrell : Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.

Jon Snow : Bring it through! And again.

Jon Snow : Very nice. Good.

Jon Snow : A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.

Jon Snow : Let's see what you can do.

Jon Snow : Olly, you just watch for now.

Olly : I can fight.

Jon Snow : Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.

Olly : I was!

Grenn : I believe you. We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. Right now, watch and learn.

Jon Snow : You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other.

Jon Snow : You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.

Locke : He wouldn't have learned anything that way.

Alliser Thorne : Lord Snow. What do you think you're doing?

Jon Snow : Grenn and I were helping them.

Alliser Thorn : Grenn's a ranger.You're a steward. Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't.

Jon Snow : Someone has to train them.

Alliser Thorne : And that someone isn't you. Go find a chamber pot to empty. Go on. Do it. You traitor's bastard. Give me an excuse. Mormont's not hereto protect you now.

Alliser Thorne : Get back to work. Now! I said now!

Janos Slynt : The bastardo s well-liked.You're not.

Alliser Thorne : You think I care if they like me? We're at war.

Janos Slynt : For now. But you can't be acting commander forever. There will be a choosing. The old maester will insist on it. You might reconsider his request to marchon Craster's. Let the mutineer stake care of Snow. Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.

Locke : A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn.

Jon Snow : My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.

Locke : Name's Locke.

Jon Snow : Jon Snow.

Jon Snow : You fight well.

Locke : What brought you up here? A sense of duty. I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm. I was a game warden in the Stormlands. Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids. I was stupid enough to get caught. Chose the Wall over losing my hand. Figured I wouldn't have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.

Alliser Thorne : Come on, get on with it. What are you waiting for? Summer?

Locke : Guess I was wrong.

Jaime Lannister : You sent for me, Your Grace?

Cersei Lannister : Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?

Jaime Lannister : Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...

Cersei Lannister : So one? You have one man guarding the future king?

Jaime Lannister : I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.

Cersei Lannister : The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?

Jaime Lannister : What?

Cersei Lannister : I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?

Jaime Lannister : You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.

Cersei Lannister : She hoped or did you promise?

Jaime Lannister : I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her.

Cersei Lannister : So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.

Jaime Lannister : I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?

Cersei Lannister : You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?

Jaime Lannister : Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?

Cersei Lannister : I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.

Jaime Lannister : I had to see him. I had to know for myself.

Cersei Lannister : And?

Jaime Lannister : He didn't do it, Cersei.

Cersei Lannister : You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander.

Tommen Lannister : Ser Pounce?

Tommen Lannister : How did you get past the Kingsguard?

Margaery Tyrell : Kingsguard.

Tommen Lannister : I don't think you're supposed to be here. Mother doesn't allow me to have visitors at night.

Margaery Tyrell : I'm not a visitor, Your Grace. Word has itI'm to be your bride.

Margaery Tyrell : Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day? Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another. Don't you think?

Tommen Lannister : Yes. But if my mother found out...

Margaery Tyrell : It can be our secret. Hmm? If we're going to be man and wife, we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope. So, Your Grace...

Tommen Lannister : Yes? Tell me a secret.

Margaery Tyrell : Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?

Tommen Lannister : That's Ser Pounce.

Margaery Tyrell : Very handsome.

Tommen Lannister : Joffrey didn't like him. He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn't know I was eating him.

Margaery Tyrell : That's very cruel. You don't strike me as cruel.

Tommen Lannister : No. I don't think I am.

Margaery Tyrell : That's a relief. Because you know what happens when we marry?

Tommen Lannister : We say our vows in front of the High Septon. And after the ceremony, there's a feast.

Margaery Tyrell : When we marry, I become yours. Forever. It's getting late. I should go. May I come and visit you again? All right, then.

Margaery Tyrell : Remember, our little secret.

Brienne : Ser Jaime Lannister. Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year. At the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king Aerys II. Pardoned by Robert Baratheon. Thereafter known as the Kingslayer.

Jaime Lannister : It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.

Brienne : Valyrian steel.

Jaime Lannister : Mmm. It's yours.

Brienne : I can't accept this.

Jaime Lannister : It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you.

Jaime Lannister : I hope I got your measurements right.

Brienne : I'll find her. For Lady Catelyn. And for you.

Jaime Lannister : I almost forgot. I have one more gift.

Brienne : I don't need a squire.

Jaime Lannister : Of course you do.

Brienne : He'll slow me down.

Jaime Lannister : My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.

Podrick : I won't slow you down, ser... my lady. I promise I'll serve you well.

Jaime Lannister : See? He's a good lad.You'll get along.

Bronn : Compliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater.

Bronn : What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse.

Jaime Lannister : They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?

Brienne : Oathkeeper.

Jaime Lannister : Good-bye, Brienne.

Podrick : Come on, move.

Sam : I should neverhave taken her away.

Jon Snow : She wasn't safe here.

Sam : She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next.

Jon Snow : Castle Black could be next.

Sam : I should go back for Gilly.

Jon Snow : We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.

Sam : I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.

Jon Snow : And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.

Sam : I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did.

Jon Snow : How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?

Sam : I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.

Jon Snow : The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...

Sam : Craster's? You think Bra nmight have found...

Locke : Snow. I don't mean to interrupt. Thorne wants to see you.

Alliser Thorne : Your foray to Craster's Keep, I'll sanction it. But I won't order anyone to go with you. Volunteers only.

Jon Snow : Thank you, Ser Alliser.

Jon Snow : Ahem, brothers.

Jon Snow : I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?

Jon Snow : I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.

Locke : Then let me say my vows. If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how.

Jon Snow : Thank you, brothers.

Woman : No, don't. Don't, please.

Woman : Please don't. Ow! You're hurting me.

Tanner : Karl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont.

Tanner : Any command for us, Lord Commander? What's that? Fuck 'em till they're dead?

Tanner : Did you hear that, boys? Fuck 'em till they're dead.

Tanner : Rast.

Tanner : Go outside and feed the beast.

Rast : We should kill that thing.

Tanner : You should shuty our fucking hole, ugly little cunt. You look likea fucking ballsack. Ugly. Look at your stupid cunt face. I could piss in any gutte rand soak five of you. Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King's Landing? Seven silvers. They told me a man's name and that man never saw daylight again. None of them cocksuckers got away from me.

Tanner : Haven't lost a fight since I was nine. Maybe it's time. What do you think, eh?

Tanner : Maybe you're the man. Eh, cunt?

Tanner : I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley. A fucking legend! I would take any knight... any knight, any time. Fucking cunts in steel plate. Fucking cowards.

Women : A gift for the gods.- A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.

Tanner : What the fuck is that?

Sissy : Craster's last child. A boy.

Tanner : What am I supposed to do with him? What did Craster do with 'em? Kill 'em before they could grow up and do the same to him? All right.

Tanner : Don't need another mouth to feed. Hand him over.

Sissy : He didn't kill them. He offered them.

Tanner : To who?

Sissy : To the gods. The white walkers.

Women : A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods. A gift for the gods.A gift for the gods.

Tanner : Shut up!

Tanner : So... if it worked for him... Let's give the walkers what they want.

Tanner : Rast is headed that way.

Rast : Pink-eyed fuck. You thirsty?

Rast : Fuck!

Hodor : Hodor.

Bran Stark : Do you hear that?

Meera : Is that a baby?

Jojen : It's coming.

Bran Stark : I'm going out there.

Meera : No, we need to stay together.

Bran Stark : I'm going.

Jojen : Bran. Bran.

Hodor : Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.

Meera : Bran, what happened?

Bran Stark : Summer, he's hurt. They've caught him in a trap.

Meera : Who?

Bran Stark : I didn't see, but they have my brother's wolf. They have Ghost.

Bran Stark : They're Night's Watch. Look. Jon might be here.

Meera : If Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?

Meera : They might have been Night'sWatch once, not anymore. We're not safe here.We need to go.

Bran Stark : No.

Meera : Bran, we need to go now.

Bran Stark : I'm not leaving without Summer.

Meera : Can you remember where the cage was?

Bran Stark : The east side of the keep.

Meera : If I'm not backsoon, we'll meet...

Rast : If I was your size, I'd be king of the fucking world.

Tanner : Help him up.

Tanner : This is nice. Fine leather. You're no wildling. Important. Highborn. Who are you?

Tanner : You see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you, I'd lose my right hand. But we're a long way from home, aren't we? And the two of you, fancy-looking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods. Isn't that a bit odd?

Tanner : I like your curly hair. My mom had curls like that. Beautiful brown curls. Why'd you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?

Tanner : See you haven't played this game before. A highborn hostage, that's valuable. But three of them, that's a lot of mouths to feed.

Rast : What the fuck's wrong with him?

Tanner : Come here.

Meera : No, please. Please.Please, let me help him.

Tanner : Who are you?

Meera : Please.

Bran Stark : I'm Brandon Stark! I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.

Rast : It's Jon Snow's brother.

Meera : It's Meera. It's Meera.I'm right here.

Tanner : And I thought this was gonnabe another boring day.

Meera : I'm right here.

Septon : May the Warrior grant him courage and protect him in these perilous times. May the Smith grant him strength that he might bear this heavy burden. And may the Crone, she that knows the fate of all men, show him the path he must walk and guide him through the dark places that lie ahead. In the light of the Seven, I now proclaim Tommen of the House Baratheon First of His Name. King of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. Long may he reign!

All : Long may he reign!

Septon : Special day.

Pycelle : Your Grace.

Varys : Your Grace.

Man : Your Grace.

Margaery Tyrell : Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : There he is.

Margaery Tyrell : Long may he reign.

Cersei Lannister : Long may he reign.

Margaery Tyrell : He sits the throne like he was born to it.

Cersei Lannister : Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?

Margaery Tyrell : No, he wasn't.

Cersei Lannister : You still mourn for Joffrey?

Margaery Tyrell : He was my husband. My king.

Cersei Lannister : He would have been your nightmare.

Margaery Tyrell : Your Grace, I feel...

Cersei Lannister : You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?

Margaery Tyrell : No.

Cersei Lannister : The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in fifty years to actually deserve it.

Margaery Tyrell : It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there.

Cersei Lannister : He will need help... if he's going to rule well.

Margaery Tyrell : He has you.

Cersei Lannister : A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?

Margaery Tyrell : Oh. After all that's happened... It sounds strange, I know, but I am... I haven't even given any thought to it, what comes next. It would be a great honor, of course. But I will have to speak to my father about it.

Cersei Lannister : Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine.

Margaery Tyrell : We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.

Margaery Tyrell : I won't even know what to call you. Sister? Or Mother? Hmm.

Jorah Mormont : King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.

Barristan : And we have taken the Meereenese Navy, Your Grace.

Daario : The Second Sons took the Meereenese Navy.

Daenerys Targaryen : Who told you to take the Navy?

Daario : No one.

Daenerys Targaryen : So why did you do it?

Daario : I heard you liked ships.

Daenerys Targaryen : How many ships?

Barristan : Ninety-three, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : How many men can they carry?

Barristan : Ninety-three hundred, not counting sailors.

Daenerys Targaryen : Would that be enough to take King's Landing?

Jorah Mormont : The Lannisters have more.

Barristan : They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years. They're tired, dispersed. And now their king is dead. Eight thousand Unsullied, two thousand Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning.

Jorah Mormont : It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you Queen of King's Landing. Ten thousand men can't conquer Westeros.

Barristan : The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.

Jorah Mormont : The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have.

Jorah Mormont : There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've re-enslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself "His Imperial Majesty."

Daenerys Targaryen : Please leave me. Not you, Jorah.

Daenerys Targaryen : It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.

Jorah Mormont : You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.

Daenerys Targaryen : You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.

Daenerys Targaryen : How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?

Jorah Mormont : You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.

Daenerys Targaryen : I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.

Jorah Mormont : What, then?

Daenerys Targaryen : I will do what queens do. I will rule.

Petyr Baelish : Pull up your hood. A memorable shade.

Sansa Stark : But how would they know?

Petyr Baelish : You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.

Sansa Stark : Is this the only way into the Eyrie?

Petyr Baelish : The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in a thousand years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth ten thousand.

Knight : Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

Petyr Baelish : Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece, Alayne.

Knight : Stand to.

Knight : Stand to!

Knight : Welcome back, Lord Baelish.

Robin : Uncle Petyr!

Petyr Baelish : My lord.

Petyr Baelish : Oh. I have brought you a gift.

Lysa : Lord Baelish.

Petyr Baelish : My lady.

Robin : Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.

Lysa : A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.

Sansa Stark : It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al...

Lysa : Oh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me.

Lysa : My flesh and blood.

Sansa Stark : It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.

Lysa : You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.

Sansa Stark : Of course. I understand.

Lysa : No one can know you're here. It would put us in a very precarious position.

Sansa Stark : I would never say a thing.

Lysa : The Lannisters want to destroy us. They've been trying for years. Now they know what it feels like.

Robin : Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.

Sansa Stark : They did, and my father's.

Robin : They killed my father, too, with poison. I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't.

Sansa Stark : Make him fly?

Robin : Through the Moon Door.

Lysa : And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll.

Sansa Stark : They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.

Lysa : I don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you?

Sansa Stark : No. We never...

Lysa : Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin.

Sansa Stark : It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.

Lysa : Robin, show Sansa to her chamber. Take the back stairs.

Petyr Baelish : Go. We'll speak soon.

Lysa : What took you so long?

Petyr Baelish : Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.

Lysa : She's here. We've spent more than enough time on her for one evening.

Lysa : Let's get married tonight.

Petyr Baelish : Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?

Lysa : There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me.

Petyr Baelish : I do think that we could wait until...

Lysa : I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?

Petyr Baelish : Like it was yesterday.

Lysa : What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husbando s wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters...

Petyr Baelish : The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.

Petyr Baelish : Tonight it is, then.

Petyr Baelish : Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately.

Lysa : I'm warning you. I'm going to scream when my husband makes love to me. I'm going to scream so loud, they'll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea.

Tywin Lannister : When will the wedding take place in your mind?

Cersei Lannister : As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.

Tywin Lannister : A fortnight?

Cersei Lannister : That seems reasonable.

Tywin Lannister : No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals.

Tywin Lannister : And your wedding to Loras?

Cersei Lannister : Shortly after Tommen's.

Tywin Lannister : Shortly?

Cersei Lannister : A fortnight.

Tywin Lannister : I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.

Cersei Lannister : We had that in common.

Tywin Lannister : You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.

Cersei Lannister : Then whom can we trust?

Tywin Lannister : Ourselves alone.

Tywin Lannister : The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.

Cersei Lannister : Robert wasn't particularly rich.

Tywin Lannister : Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.

Cersei Lannister : I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.

Tywin Lannister : Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?

Cersei Lannister : Haven't a clue.

Tywin Lannister : Go on, your best guess.

Cersei Lannister : Pounds, tons, ounces?

Tywin Lannister : Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.

Cersei Lannister : That can't be.

Tywin Lannister : Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.

Cersei Lannister : Then how do we pay for anything?

Tywin Lannister : The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.

Cersei Lannister : How much?

Tywin Lannister : A tremendous amount.

Cersei Lannister : There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.

Tywin Lannister : The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.

Cersei Lannister : Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.

Tywin Lannister : And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for a thousand years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect.

Cersei Lannister : It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do.

Tywin Lannister : I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you.

Cersei Lannister : I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.

Cersei Lannister : The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?

Arya Stark : Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.

Sandor Clegane : Would you shut up?

Arya Stark : I can't sleep until I say the names.

Sandor Clegane : The names of every fucking person in Westeros?

Arya Stark : Only the ones I'm going to kill.

Sandor Clegane : Hate's as good a thing as any to keep a person going. Better than most. We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list.

Arya Stark : If he were here right now, what would you do?

Sandor Clegane : I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men.

Arya Stark : I'm almost done. Only one name left.

Sandor Clegane : Go on.

Arya Stark : The Hound.

Sansa Stark : Thank you.

Lysa : Your mother always had a sweet tooth, you know?

Sansa Stark : Really?

Lysa : Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat.

Sansa Stark : My mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food.

Lysa : This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?

Sansa Stark : They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.

Lysa : Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder.

Sansa Stark : Yes. I'm very lucky.

Lysa : He feels responsible for you.

Sansa Stark : Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful.

Lysa : Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?

Sansa Stark : Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much.

Lysa : Loved your mother.

Sansa Stark : No.

Lysa : That's what you wanted to say.

Sansa Stark : He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you.

Lysa : Your mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?

Lysa : He hasn't told you about the vile things they do with their bodies? The vile things they let him do with their bodies?

Sansa Stark : No, never.

Lysa : Are you pregnant?

Sansa Stark : What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never-

Lysa : I wasn't asking about Tyrion. What have you let Petyr do with your body?

Sansa Stark : Aunt Lysa, no, I-

Lysa : Your young, pretty body.

Sansa Stark : Nothing. I'm a virgin.

Lysa : Don't lie to me.

Sansa Stark : You're hurting me.

Lysa : I'll know if you lie.

Sansa Stark : I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever.

Lysa : Shh. Shh. Shh. It's all right. It will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon. They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin. You'll be the Lady of the Vale. Hmm.

Brienne : Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?

Podrick : Yes, my lady, when I was young. There wasn't much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though. He preferred litters.

Brienne : Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather.

Podrick : That's a long way off.

Brienne : Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point.

Podrick : Never, my lady. I'm your squire.

Brienne : I've made it this far in the world without a squire. I don't see why I need one now.

Podrick : All knights have squires, my lady.

Brienne : I'm not a knight. And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you.

Podrick : I swore an oath, my lady.

Brienne : I am releasing you from that oath. That means you could leave.

Podrick : I know.

Brienne : What do you think will happen if you leave?

Podrick : They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.

Sandor Clegane : The hell you doing?

Arya Stark : Practicing.

Sandor Clegane : What, ways to die?

Arya Stark : No one's going to kill me.

Sandor Clegane : They will if you nance around like that. That's no way to fight.

Arya Stark : It's not fighting. It's water dancing.

Sandor Clegane : Dancing? Maybe you ought to put on a dress. Who taught you that shite?

Arya Stark : The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos.

Sandor Clegane : Braavos. Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet. They all are.

Arya Stark : What do you know about anything?

Sandor Clegane : I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey's cunt.

Arya Stark : It was not.

Sandor Clegane : Was? He dead?

Arya Stark : Yes.

Sandor Clegane : How?

Arya Stark : He was killed.

Sandor Clegane : Who by?

Arya Stark : Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn-

Sandor Clegane : Meryn Trant? The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?

Arya Stark : He was outnumbered.

Sandor Clegane : Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.

Arya Stark : Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.

Sandor Clegane : The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn't have a sword? All right. You have a sword. Let's see what he taught you. Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend. Dead like all the rest of your friends.

Sandor Clegane : Your friendo s dead and Meryn Trant's not 'cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword.

Oberyn Martell : Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?

Oberyn Martell : A poem, actually.

Cersei Lannister : May I show you the gardens?

Oberyn Martell : I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.

Cersei Lannister : No, you couldn't.

Cersei Lannister : I didn't realize you were a poet.

Oberyn Martell : Not a very good one.

Cersei Lannister : For your paramour?

Oberyn Martell : For one of my daughters.

Cersei Lannister : You have several, don't you?

Oberyn Martell : Eight.

Cersei Lannister : Eight? Eight daughters?

Oberyn Martell : The fifth is difficult. I named her after my sister Elia.

Cersei Lannister : Beautiful name.

Oberyn Martell : Yes. But I can't say it without turning sad. And after I turn sad, I grow angry.

Cersei Lannister : Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?

Oberyn Martell : Which joke is that?

Cersei Lannister : You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for nineteen years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?

Oberyn Martell : We can avenge them.

Cersei Lannister : Yes, we can avenge them.

Oberyn Martell : You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?

Cersei Lannister : I know he did.

Oberyn Martell : We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.

Cersei Lannister : We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year.

Oberyn Martell : The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens. Laughing in the sun.

Cersei Lannister : I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.

Oberyn Martell : You have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.

Cersei Lannister : Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again.

Oberyn Martell : Anything at all.

Cersei Lannister : The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.

Oberyn Martell : I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.

Cersei Lannister : Please tell her... her mother misses her very much.

Podrick : Oh, no, no, no.

Podrick : No, no, no, no.

Podrick : Hells. Gods.

Brienne : Did you remove the skin?

Podrick : No, my lady.

Brienne : Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?

Brienne : Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?

Podrick : No, my lady. That was the cooks.

Brienne : What are you doing?

Podrick : I'm helping you with your armor.

Brienne : I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much.

Brienne : What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?

Podrick : I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished. I kept his clothing and linens clean. Carried his messages and returned the replies. Mostly I poured wine.

Brienne : Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?

Podrick : I killed a man.

Brienne : Who?

Podrick : A Kingsguard. He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.

Brienne : How did you kill a Kingsguard?

Podrick : I pushed a spear through the back of his head.

Brienne : Bloody ridiculous. Help me with these straps.

Rast : Hey. Hey, get up. Get up.

Man : That's it lad, put it inside. Get the fire going again. We're all freezing.

Man : Aye. What we need is a girl there.

Man : I've got to have a piss.

Man : Now keep quiet.

Meera : You need water.

Jojen : It doesn't matter.

Meera : Of course it matters.

Jojen : You mustn't let anything stop you.

Bran Stark : They already have stopped me.

Jojen : No. You're not here. You're far from here.

Meera : What does that mean?

Jojen : At the hill. A great weirwood tree.

Bran Stark : You've seen it, too.

Jojen : Meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you. He's waiting for you. We have to find it. You have to make it.

Bran Stark : We will.

Jojen : This... this isn't the end. Not for you. Not yet.

Meera : How... will we know the end?

Jojen : You'll know.

Locke : Brothers.

Dolorous Edd : You do move quiet.

Jon Snow : How many?

Locke : Eleven men. Most of them already drunk. No guards posted. They don't seem to have a care in the world. We'll carve them up like walnut pie.

Grenn : Karl was a top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom. I've seen what he can do with a knife.

Locke : Have you seen what I can do with a knife?

Grenn : Not yet.

Locke : There's a hut on the west side of the keep. We should steer clear of it.

Jon Snow : Why?

Locke : They've got some hounds chained up inside. Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better.

Grenn : New moon tonight.

Jon Snow : Get some rest. We move at sundown.

Karl Tanner : I've always liked a girl with curls. A touch of class. You take whatever's left.

Karl Tanner : Get her up.

Bran Stark : Stop.

Jojen : Stop. What are you doing?

Hodor : Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.

Bran Stark : Stop. Stop!

Hodor : Hodor. Hodor.

Bran Stark : Stop! Please.

Hodor : Hodor.

Bran Stark : Please, get off her!

Bran Stark : Please! Please, leave her alone!

Bran Stark : Please, stop. Stop.

Bran Stark : What are you doing? Leave her alone!

Bran Stark : No!

Karl Tanner : Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

Karl : Shh.

Karl Tanner : You've got pretty hair, don't you? Now what is a pretty little highborn girl like you doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh? You left your daddy's castle looking for trouble, didn't you? No dresses for you. You like it rough, don't you? You like it in the gutter, don't you?

Jojen : If you let my sister go, I can help you.

Karl Tanner : You can help me?

Jojen : I can.

Karl Tanner : And how you gonna do that?

Jojen : I have the sight. I can see things.

Karl Tanner : That's very helpful.

Jojen : Things that haven't happened yet.

Karl Tanner : What a fine thing. A fine thing.

Karl Tanner : Have you seen what I'm gonna do to your sister? Have you seen what they're going to do to your sister?

Jojen : No.

Karl Tanner : Don't close your eyes.

Jojen : I saw you die tonight. I saw your body burn. I saw the snow fall and bury your bones.

Man : To arms!

Rast : They're here, the Night's Watch.

Locke : Rescue party is here, lads. Lady.

Bran Stark : Is Jon with you?

Locke : Aye. I'll take you to him.

Locke : You're Brandon Stark?

Locke : The little crippled lord. We're going for a ride, boy.

Bronn : Jon! Jon!

Locke : Keep talking and I'll cut your friends' throats. Starting with the idiot. Do you hear? Do you hear?

Hodor : Hodor! Hodor! Hodor. Hodor.

Hodor : Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.

Bran Stark : Hodor. Hodor, get his knife. Cut me loose.

Bran Stark : Hodor, get his knife. Hodor. Cut me loose, Hodor.

Bran Stark : Jojen and Meera, free them. Go!

Bran Stark : Jon.

Bran Stark : Jon!

Jojen : If he sees you, he won't let you go north.

Bran Stark : He's my brother.

Jojen : And wants to protect you. He'll take you back to Castle Black.

Jojen : You have to decide. Do you want to find the three-eyed raven?

Bran Stark : Hodor.

Bran Stark : We need to free Summer. And we need to go.

Karl Tanner : Lord Snow. Are you bringing me back for trial?

Karl Tanner : We had a good thing here. We were free men. You'll never be free. You'll never know what that's like.

Karl Tanner : You learn how to fight in a castle?

Karl Tanner : Some old man teach you how to stand, how to parry?

Karl Tanner : How to fight with honor?

Karl Tanner : You know what's wrong with honor?

Karl Tanner : You.

Jon Snow : Are you all right? Come with me. Come on.

Jon Snow : We lost four brothers?

Doloroud Edd : Five.

Grenn : What the seven hells could do that to a man?

Jon Snow : I count ten dead mutineers.

Grenn : Locke said there were eleven of them.

Dolrous Edd : Where's Rast?

Man : Here's another.

Grenn : Jon.

Jon Snow : Where in seven hells? Come here.

Jon Snow : I missed you, boy.

Dolorous Edd : What should we do with this lot?

Jon Snow : It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.

Morag : Meaning all respect, Ser Crow, Craster beat us and worse. Your brother crows beat us and worse. We'll find our own way.

Jon Snow : You want to stay here in Craster's Keep?

Morag : Burn it to the ground and all the dead with it.

Davos : Your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that--

Stannis Baratheon : We've been here since midday.

Davos : Easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found. Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos. Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest--

Tycho : Welcome to the Iron Bank. Please, sit.

Tycho : What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?

Davos : This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.

Tycho : The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.

Stannis Baratheon : He shares no blood with me. He is a bastard born of incest. As was his brother before him.

Tycho : Yes, we have heard this story.

Stannis Baratheon : It's not a story. It's the truth.

Tycho : The king's grandfather tells a different story. A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.

Stannis Baratheon : Gold you loaned him.

Tycho : And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?

Stannis Baratheon : More than any man living.

Tycho : Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like "usurper" and "madman" and "blood right." Here, our books are filled with numbers. We prefer the stories they tell. More plain. Less open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you?

Stannis Baratheon : 4000

Tycho : And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.

Davos : 32

Tycho : And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?

Stannis Baratheon : None.

Tycho : You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective. I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request. But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.

Davos : My lord.

Tycho : I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. You would not be either here. In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles.

Davos : Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another. {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers.

Davos : This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive.

Tycho : The war is over.

Davos : As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?

Tycho : Ser Davos...

Davos : Humor me.

Tycho : Tywin Lannister.

Davos : How old is Tywin Lannister?

Tycho : 67

Stannis Baratheon : 67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back?

Tycho : That is a problem for another time.

Davos : Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it.

Sallador : The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way. The captain shouts to his first mate, "Bring me my red shirt." The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on. And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory. A few days later, the lookout screams, "Two pirate ships!" The crew is shivering like scared mice. But the courageous captain hollers, "Bring me my red shirt!"

Sallador : After the battle, the first mate asks, "Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?" The captain replies, "So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed." The next morning the lookout screams, "10 pirate ships! We are surrounded!" The crew goes silent.

Sallador : They all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command. Calm as ever, the captain bellows...

Women : Bring me my brown pants!

Davos : You think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke?

Sallador : Davos. I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.

Davos : Only half rotted.

Sallador : Join us, my friend. Join us. This is Lhara. And this is--

Lhara : I am Lhara.

Sallador : She's an artist, this one, truly.

Davos : No time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise.

Sallador : We?

Davos : You, me-- we.

Sallador : Once I thought this man loved me. Now I know he despises me. He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold--

Davos : You won't be alone. And you won't be poor.

Davos : There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house. I gave it to your wife.

Sallador : You're not my friend, my friend.

Davos : I'll see you at sunrise.

Yara Greyjoy : I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call home. On the first night of the full moon, I will hunt down every islander still on our lands and flay them living, the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell. In the box you'll find a special gift-- Theon's favorite toy. He cried when I took it away from him. Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.

Myranda : Yes!

Yara Greyjoy : They skinned our countrymen and they mutilated my brother, your prince. Your prince. Everything they've done to him, they've also done to you.

Myranda : Yes! Yes!

Yara Greyjoy : As long as they can hurt our prince with impunity, the word ironborn means nothing.

First Mate : Go left.

Yara Greyjoy : Theon Greyjoy.

Bolton Guard : I don't know--

Yara Greyjoy : I'm here for Theon Greyjoy. Take me to the dungeons.

Bolton Guard : He's not in the dungeons.

Bolton Guard : Last cage on the right.

Yara Greyjoy : Thank you.

Yara Greyjoy : This way!

Yara Greyjoy : We're going home.

Theon Greyjoy : No!

Yara Greyjoy : It's all right. It's me, Yara.

Theon Greyjoy : You can't trick me. Tell him. Tell him you couldn't trick me.

Yara Greyjoy : I'm not tricking you, Theon. I'm saving you.

Theon Greyjoy : Not Theon! Reek! Reek! My name is Reek!

First Mate : They're here.

Yara Greyjoy : If they catch us in here, we're trapped. Help me with him.

Theon Greyjoy : No, you can't! You can't!

Yara Greyjoy : You're Theon Greyjoy.

Theon Greyjoy : No, I don't believe her! I know who I am! I'm Reek! Reek! Loyal Reek! Good Reek! I've always been Reek!

Ramsay Bolton : This is turning into a lovely evening.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm Reek! Loyal Reek!

Yara Greyjoy : Aah! Theon!

Yara Greyjoy : Give me my brother and no more of your men will die.

Ramsay Bolton : You've got bigger balls than he ever did. But with those big balls of yours...

Ramsay Bolton : how fast can you run?

Yara Greyjoy : Make for the ship, now.

Ironborn : But your brother.

Yara Greyjoy : My brother is dead.

Ramsay Bolton : I have a treat for you. A reward.

Theon Greyjoy : Reward?

Ramsay Bolton : Yes, Reek. Those creatures who came in the night, they wanted to take you away. And you didn't let them. You remained loyal.

Theon Greyjoy : I-- I didn't want them to take me. I was so scared. I didn't want them--

Ramsay Bolton : Yes, yes, Reek. It's a bath. For you. Remove those rags. Now.

Ramsay Bolton : The britches, too, Reek. Take them off.

Ramsay Bolton : Do you love me, Reek?

Theon Greyjoy : Yes, of course, my lord.

Ramsay Bolton : Good. Because I need you to do something for me. Something very important. There's a castle, you see. Some bad men hold this castle. I need your help to take this castle back.

Theon Greyjoy : But how can--

Ramsay Bolton : I need you to play a role. To pretend to be someone you're not.

Theon Greyjoy : Pretend to be who?

Ramsay Bolton : Theon Greyjoy.

Daenerys Targaryen : You stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons. Don't be afraid, my friend.

Missandei : The Queen says you may approach and speak.

Missandei : He is a goatherd. He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters.

Daenerys Targaryen : I thank him for his prayers.

Missandei : It was your dragons, he says. They came this morning for his flock.

Missandei : He hopes he has not offended Your Grace, but now he has nothing.

Daenerys Targaryen : Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship. I cannot bring back his goats,

Daenerys Targaryen : but I will see he is paid their value three times over.

Daenerys Targaryen : Send the next one in.

Manservant : The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq begs an audience with the Queen.

Daenerys Targaryen : The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself.

Hizdahr : Queen Daenerys. Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.

Daenerys Targaryen : I thank you.

Hizdahr : Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.

Daenerys Targaryen : Then it is my honor to receive you.

Hizdahr : My father, one of Meereen's most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks. This pyramid included.

Daenerys Targaryen : For that, he has my gratitude. I should be honored to meet him.

Hizdahr : You have, Your Grace. You crucified him. I pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly.

Daenerys Targaryen : Your father crucified innocent children.

Hizdahr : My father spoke out against crucifying those children. He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled. Is it justice to answer one crime with another?

Daenerys Targaryen : I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that.

Hizdahr : What's done is done. You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen. A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.

Daenerys Targaryen : And what traditions do you speak of?

Hizdahr : The tradition of funeral rite. Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces. My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun.

Hizdahr : Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials.

Daenerys Targaryen : And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?

Hizdahr : Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters. I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father. Let me take his body down. Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world.

Daenerys Targaryen : Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq.

Hizdahr : Thank you, my queen.

Daenerys Targaryen : How many more?

Missandei : There are 212 supplicants waiting, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : 212?

Oberyn Martell : These meetings aren't always going to be this early, are they? I was up late last night. So, does this mean I am a master of something now? Coins, ships?

Mace : Lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you--

Mace : Lord Tywin, it's a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council. I--

Tywin Lannister : The trial begins this afternoon. We only have the morning for affairs of state. Shall we begin?

Varys : Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord.

Cersei Lannister : A coward and a traitor.

Varys : My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers. I believe the phrase "fuck the king" was uttered.

Pycelle : Disgraceful.

Tywin Lannister : What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?

Varys : 10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.

Tywin Lannister : Make it 100. What else?

Varys : More whispers from the east, my lord.

Tywin Lannister : The Targaryen girl?

Varys : Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.

Cersei Lannister : Conquered with what?

Varys : She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen. Some 8,000 strong. She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons. She has two knights advising her-- Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. And she has three dragons.

Cersei Lannister : Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace.

Pycelle : Mormont is spying on her for us.

Varys : No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.

Cersei Lannister : He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.

Tywin Lannister : Joffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.

Cersei Lannister : Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.

Varys : A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace.

Oberyn Martell : Lord Varys is right. I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand. They are very impressive on the battlefield. Less so in the bedroom.

Tywin Lannister : Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with.

Pycelle : How, my lord? By force?

Tywin Lannister : Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?

Varys : Most certainly, my Lord Hand.

Tywin Lannister : Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man. Fetch my quill and paper.

Varys : Prince Oberyn.

Oberyn Martell : Lord Varys...

Varys : Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord.

Oberyn Martell : And yet everyone does.

Varys : You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?

Oberyn Martell : Five years.

Varys : May I ask why?

Oberyn Martell : Tis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.

Varys : Most of us aren't princes.

Oberyn Martell : You are from Essos. Where? Lys?

Varys : I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.

Oberyn Martell : I have an ear for that as well. How did you get here?

Varys : It's a long story.

Oberyn Martell : One you don't like telling people.

Varys : People I trust.

Oberyn Martell : My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting. You should come to the brothel and meet her. We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here. We have some lovely boys on retainer, but...

Oberyn Martell : You did like boys before?

Oberyn Martell : Really? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.

Varys : Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either.

Oberyn Martell : What then?

Varys : Nothing.

Oberyn Martell : Everybody is interested in something.

Varys : Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.

Oberyn Martell : Such as?

Tyrion Lannister : Let me guess, I've been pardoned.

Tyrion Lannister : Really?

Jaime Lannister : Father's orders.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, we mustn't disappoint Father.

Man : Kingslayer!

Tommen Lannister : I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial. Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead. And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell. And if found guilty... may the gods punish the accused.

Tywin Lannister : Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey?

Tyrion Lannister : No.

Tywin Lannister : Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?

Tyrion Lannister : Not that I know of.

Tywin Lannister : How would you say he died, then?

Tyrion Lannister : Choked on his pigeon pie.

Tywin Lannister : So you would blame the bakers?

Tyrion Lannister : Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.

Tywin Lannister : The crown may call its first witness.

Meryn Trant : Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him. He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?

Tywin Lannister : Silence.

Tyrion Lannister : Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.

Tywin Lannister : Silence! You will not speak unless called upon. You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.

Pycelle : Basilisk venom, widow's blood, wolfsbane, essence of nightshade, sweetsleep, tears of Lys, demon's dance... blind eye--

Oberyn Martell : I think you have made your point, Grand Maester. You have a lot of poison in your store.

Pycelle : Had, Prince Oberyn. My stores were plundered.

Tywin Lannister : By whom?

Pycelle : By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned.

Tywin Lannister : Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him?

Pycelle : Without question.

Pycelle : This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool. He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast. She wore this necklace the day of the wedding. Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside.

Tywin Lannister : Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?

Pyelle : It was. The Strangler. A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess. And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.

Cersei Lannister : I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.

Mace : Your own brother said this to you?

Cersei Lannister : Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops.

Oberyn Martell : Tyrion said, "And you will know the debt is paid." What debt?

Cersei Lannister : I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.

Tywin Lannister : Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony.

Mace : Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?

Varys : I'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, "Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."

Mace : And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?

Varys : Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.

Tywin Lannister : You're excused, Lord Varys.

Tyrion Lannister : Father, may I ask the witness one question?

Tywin Lannister : One.

Tyrion Lannister : You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?

Varys : Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing.

Tywin Lannister : We will adjourn for now.

Tywin Lannister : Toll the bells in an hour's time.

Guard : Clear the court!

Jaime Lannister : You'd condemn your own son to death?

Tywin Lannister : I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.

Jaime Lannister : This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.

Tywin Lannister : I know nothing of the sort.

Jaime Lannister : You've always hated Tyrion.

Tywin Lannister : He killed his king.

Jaime Lannister : As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?

Tywin Lannister : It won't be murder. It'll be justice.

Jaime Lannister : Justice?

Tywin Lannister : I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly.

Jaime Lannister : He'll be executed.

Tywin Lannister : No, he'll be punished accordingly.

Jaime Lannister : Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.

Tywin Lannister : I'm well aware of your oath.

Jaime Lannister : What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?

Tywin Lannister : What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?

Jaime Lannister : It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.

Tywin Lannister : Done.

Tywin Lannister : When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again.

Jaime Lannister : You have my word.

Tywin Lannister : And you have mine.

Tyrion Lannister : Not going well, is it?

Jaime Lannister : You're going to be found guilty.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, you think so?

Jaime Lannister : When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch.

Tyrion Lannister : Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.

Jaime Lannister : Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.

Tyrion Lannister : How do you know?

Jaime Lannister : Do you trust me?

Jaime Lannister : Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.

Tywin Lannister : The crown may call its next witness.

Tywin Lannister : State your name.

Shae : Shae.

Tywin Lannister : Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?

Shae : I swear it.

Tywin Lannister : Do you know this man?

Shae : Yes. Tyrion Lannister.

Tywin Lannister : How do you know him?

Shae : I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.

Tywin Lannister : This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?

Shae : I know that he's guilty.

Shae : He and Sansa planned it together.

Tywin Lannister : Silence! Continue.

Shae : She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother. She blamed their deaths on the king. Tyrion was happy to help. He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen. He hated you, my lord.

Shae : He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.

Oberyn Martell : How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?

Shae : I wasn't just her maid. I was his whore.

Mace : I beg your pardon? You said you were his...

Shae : His whore.

Tywin Lannister : How did you come to be in his service?

Shae : He stole me. I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army. But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent. He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion. "You belong to me now," he said. "I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."

Tywin Lannister : Silence. Silence!

Oberyn Martell : And did you?

Shae : Did I what?

Oberyn Martell : Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.

Shae : I did everything he wanted. Whatever he told me to do to him. Whatever he felt like doing to me. I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted. I let him put himself where he wanted. I was his property. I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored. He ordered me to call him "my lion," so I did. I took his face in my hands and said, "I am yours and you are mine."

Tyrion Lannister : Shae. Please don't.

Shae : I am a whore. Remember? That was before he married Sansa. After that, all he wanted was her. But she wouldn't let him into her bed. So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.

Tyrion Lannister : Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess.

Tywin Lannister : You wish to confess?

Tyrion Lannister : I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.

Tywin Lannister : Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?

Tywin Lannister : You admit you poisoned the king?

Tyrion Lannister : No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf.

Tywin Lannister : You are not on trial for being a dwarf.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life.

Tywin Lannister : Have you nothing to say in your defense?

Tyrion Lannister : Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had.

Tyrion Lannister : Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores.

Tyrion Lannister : I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.

Tywin Lannister : Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.

Tyrion Lannister : I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.

Jaime Lannister : I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?

Jaime Lannister : You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?

Tyrion Lannister : Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it.

Jaime Lannister : You fell in love with a whore.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son.

Jaime Lannister : Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.

Tyrion Lannister : At least I got to tell them what they really are.

Jaime Lannister : Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride.

Tyrion Lannister : Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me.

Jaime Lannister : I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.

Tyrion Lannister : Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall.

Tyrion Lannister : Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.

Jaime Lannister : It is tempting.

Tyrion Lannister : Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life.

Jaime Lannister : If he wins.

Tyrion Lannister : Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.

Jaime Lannister : No. Not Ser Meryn.

Guard : Go on, move it.

Guard : And you. Come on.

Prisoner : Mercy. Please. Please, mercy.

Cersei Lannister : Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.

Cersei Lannister : You seem to be in good form.

Mountain : Who am I fighting?

Cersei Lannister : Does it matter?

Sandor Clegane : Could be food.

Arya Stark : Could be soldiers.

Arya Stark : You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.

Dying Man : Where else to sit? Tried to walk back to my hut, hurt too much. Then I remembered they burned my hut down.

Sandor Clegane : Who were "they"?

Dying Man : I stopped asking a while ago.

Sandor Clegane : That's not gonna get better.

Dying Man : Doesn't seem so.

Sandor Clegane : A bad way to go. Haven't you had enough?

Dying Man : Of what? I know. Time to go. Take matters into my own hands. The thought has occurred to me.

Arya Stark : So why go on?

Dying Man : Habit.

Arya Stark : Nothing could be worse than this.

Dying Man : Maybe nothing is worse than this.

Arya Stark : Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.

Dying Man : Who are you?

Arya Stark : My name is Arya. Arya Stark.

Dying Man : You her father?

Sandor Clegane : Her captor. Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.

Dying Man : A fair exchange, that is. Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings. You give me, I give you. Fair. A balance. No balance anymore. Could I have a drink? Dying is thirsty work.

Dying Man : Wish it were wine.

Sandor Clegane : So do I.

Sandor Clegane : That's where the heart is. That's how you kill a man.

Sandor Clegane : The fuck you doing?

Rorge : There's a price on your head.

Sandor Clegane : Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.

Rorge : The king's dead. He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding. The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers. 100 silver stags.

Sandor Clegane : And you thought you were going to collect it? Didn't think very hard, did you?

Arya Stark : You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.

Sandor Clegane : This day's really not working out the way you planned. He on your little list?

Arya Stark : He can't be. I don't know his name.

Sandor Clegane : What's your name?

Rorge : Rorge.

Arya Stark : Thank you.

Sandor Clegane : You're learning.

Man : Rangers returning!

Man : They return!

Jon Snow : Greetings.

Man : Didn't think I'd see you again.

Sam : All right, Jon?

Man : Welcome back, brother.

Alliser : Lord Snow.

Alliser : This is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.

Jon Snow : Come on, Ghost.

Jon Snow : Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.

Janos Slynt : I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?

Jon Snow : We need to prepare.

Alliser : We've been preparing.

Jon Snow : We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.

Alliser : And how would we range north?

Jon Snow : We wouldn't.

Alliser : Coward. You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?

Grenn : We can't defend the gate against a hundred thousand men.

Alliser : This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel.

Jon Snow : Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have.

Alliser : The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.

Jon Snow : They won't stop them.

Alliser : Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow.

Jon Snow : The stewards.

Alliser : Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?

Jon Snow : No.

Alliser : Who would that be?

Jon Snow : The builders.

Alliser : Ah, the builders. First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night's Watch. Do you agree with him?

Yarwick : No.

Alliser : Given your deep knowledge of the Wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon.

Alliser : Moving on. First Builder, we'll need a hundred barrels of pitch brought atop the wall.

Yarwick : Aye.

Bronn : My lord.

Tyrion Lannister : You have new clothes.

Bronn : Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.

Tyrion Lannister : I sent for you days ago.

Bronn : I've been a bit busy.

Tyrion Lannister : Doing what?

Bronn : My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.

Tyrion Lannister : Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.

Bronn : I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.

Tyrion Lannister : She's dim-witted.

Bronn : If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.

Tyrion Lannister : When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?

Bronn : Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister.

Tyrion Lannister : And you understand the rules of inheritance?

Bronn : Falyse is forty and barren.

Tyrion Lannister : She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.

Bronn : She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.

Bronn : What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.

Tyrion Lannister : You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?

Bronn : You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price.

Tyrion Lannister : Is it two wives you want or two castles?

Bronn : One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.

Bronn : I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?

Tyrion Lannister : You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.

Bronn : Your sister's a Lannister, too.

Tyrion Lannister : My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it.

Bronn : If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink.

Tyrion Lannister : Does he frighten you so much?

Bronn : I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?

Tyrion Lannister : Because you're my friend.

Bronn : Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?

Bronn : I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more.

Tyrion Lannister : I understand.

Bronn : I'm sorry it has to be this way.

Tyrion Lannister : Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.

Bronn : We had some good days together.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, we did.

Bronn : What will you do?

Tyrion Lannister : I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?

Bronn : I hope to hear them sing it one day.

Daenerys Targaryen : How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,

Daario : But your window is not.

Daario : I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.

Daenerys Targaryen : Don't do that again.

Daario : Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.

Daenerys Targaryen : These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you.

Daario : Forgive me, my queen. I live to serve you.

Daenerys Targaryen : Tell me why you're here.

Daario : I came to ask a favor. I only have two talents in this world- war and women. You are staying here in Meereen to rule. That is a wise decision. I respect it. But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents.

Daenerys Targaryen : I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.

Daario : You've ordered us to be night watchmen.

Daenerys Targaryen : And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue.

Daario : There is only one, and she does not want me.

Daenerys Targaryen : You swore me your sword.

Daario : My sword is yours till the day I die.

Daenerys Targaryen : So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?

Daario : I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.

Daenerys Targaryen : Very well.

Daenerys Targaryen : Do what you do best.

Daenerys Targaryen : Take off your clothes.

Selyse : Oh.

Melisandre : Come in, my queen. Please.

Selyse : I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady.

Melisandre : You could never disturb me.

Selyse : I just wanted to speak with you before we left.

Melisandre : Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.

Melisandre : No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one.

Melisandre : When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, "Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count." A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid.

Selyse : It was. I- humor isn't my strength.

Melisandre : That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.

Selyse : If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?

Melisandre : Not always.

Melisandre : Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lordo s power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust.

Selyse : Did you use it with Stannis?

Melisandre : No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.

Melisandre : It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.

Selyse : No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home.

Melisandre : I understand how you feel.

Selyse : Hmm.

Melisandre : But that is impossible.

Selyse : Why?

Melisandre : You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lordo s light and see his truth for yourself.

Melisandre : However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her.

Daario : Jorah the Andal. Are you here to see our queen? She's in a good mood.

Jorah Mormont : Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : You're here early.

Jorah Mormont : Later than some.

Daenerys Targaryen : You don't approve?

Jorah Mormont : It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust.

Daenerys Targaryen : You neither approve nor trust.

Jorah Mormont : Why would I? The man's a sellsword.

Daenerys Targaryen : Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?

Jorah Mormont : I did.

Daenerys Targaryen : I trust you.

Jorah Mormont : Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?

Daenerys Targaryen : I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.

Jorah Mormont : You have?

Daenerys Targaryen : I have.

Jorah Mormont : Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control.

Daenerys Targaryen : That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself.

Jorah Mormont : Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them.

Daenerys Targaryen : And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?

Jorah Mormont : It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.

Daenerys Targaryen : Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.

Jorah Mormont : I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : And now you are helping me show them to freedom.

Jorah Mormont : I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.

Daenerys Targaryen : The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.

Jorah Mormont : Hizdahr zo Loraq?

Daenerys Targaryen : He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.

Daenerys Targaryen : Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind.

Jorah Mormont : Yes, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : No. Tell him you changed my mind.

Sandor Clegane : Rat cunts. Fucking whore.

Arya Stark : You're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right-

Sandor Clegane : No fire.

Arya Stark : It'll only take a second. It won't hurt that much.

Sandor Clegane : No fire!

Sandor Clegane : Shut up about it. Shut up about everything. Thanks to you, I'm a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway. Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we're going.

Sandor Clegane : I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword.

Sandor Clegane : My brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.

Arya Stark : Why?

Sandor Clegane : Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?

Arya Stark : Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.

Brienne : Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.

Podrick : Couldn't agree more, my lady.

Brienne : Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.

Podrick : Yes, my lady.

Brienne : Don't get drunk.

Podrick : No, my lady.

Hot Pie : Can I get you anything else?

Brienne : No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful.

Hot Pie : Thanks. I do my best.

Hot Pie : A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?

Brienne : No.

Hot Pie : Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?

Brienne : We're looking for someone.

Hot Pie : Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had seventeen-

Brienne : A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name.

Hot Pie : Starks? What, like them lot from "Winterhell"?

Hot Pie : No, ain't seen anyone like that. I heard they was all traitors. Don't need no traitors in here.

Brienne : I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.

Hot Pie : Sure I can't get you a bit more kidney pie?

Brienne : What?

Podrick : It's nothing, my lady.

Brienne : You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.

Podrick : Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't.

Brienne : You're not interesting enough to be offensive.

Podrick : The Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.

Hot Pie : My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?

Brienne : What about? Not kidney pie.

Hot Pie : You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.

Brienne : No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.

Hot Pie : She weren't when I last spoke to her.

Brienne : When was that?

Hot Pie : Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry.

Brienne : So what happened to her?

Hot Pie : Well-

Brienne : The quick version.

Hot Pie : The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.

Podrick : The Hound.

Hot Pie : That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better.

Brienne : Um, you were saying?

Brienne : Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun.

Podrick : They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady.

Brienne : Why the Eyrie?

Podrick : Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who.

Brienne : Sansa could be there, too.

Podrick : Aye, my lady. Could be.

Brienne : You sure about this?

Podrick : No.

Tyrion Lannister : I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.

Oberyn Martell : I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.

Tyrion Lannister : Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like.

Oberyn Martell : Your sister.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh.

Oberyn Martell : Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.

Tyrion Lannister : Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.

Oberyn Martell : It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.

Tyrion Lannister : She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.

Oberyn Martell : Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago.

Tyrion Lannister : I think I would have remembered that.

Oberyn Martell : Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you.

Tyrion Lannister : You and my family have more in common than you might admit.

Oberyn Martell : The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.

Tyrion Lannister : That would have made things so much easier.

Oberyn Martell : When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, "Soon." Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. "That's not a monster," I told Cersei. "That's just a baby." And she said, "He killed my mother." And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. "It doesn't matter," she told us. "Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."

Tyrion Lannister : Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.

Oberyn Martell : And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.

Tyrion Lannister : If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.

Oberyn Martell : I disagree.

Oberyn Martell : I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion.

Sansa Stark : Hello, Robin.

Robin : What are you doing?

Sansa Stark : I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time.

Robin : Why did you leave?

Sansa Stark : It's a long story.

Robin : I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.

Sansa Stark : Yes, you certainly are.

Robin : When will you go back?

Sansa Stark : Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.

Robin : Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?

Sansa Stark : No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground.

Robin : That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?

Sansa Stark : We don't.

Robin : What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?

Sansa Stark : I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.

Robin : Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door.

Sansa Stark : I like the sound of that.

Robin : Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.

Sansa Stark : All right.

Robin : It can go in here in this big tower.

Sansa Stark : Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.

Robin : I didn't ruin it.

Sansa Stark : You did.

Robin : It was already ruined because it didn't have a Moon Door. I was fixing it.

Sansa Stark : Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.

Robin : I didn't ruin it!

Sansa Stark : You're being stupid.

Sansa Stark : Robin, I'm sorry, I-

Petyr Baelish : Children.

Sansa Stark : I hit him.

Petyr Baelish : Yes, I saw.

Sansa Stark : I shouldn't have done that.

Petyr Baelish : No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction.

Sansa Stark : If he tells Aunt Lysa...

Petyr Baelish : Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.

Sansa Stark : I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.

Petyr Baelish : A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one.

Sansa Stark : Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.

Petyr Baelish : I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world.

Petyr Baelish : You're more beautiful than she ever was.

Sansa Stark : Lord Baelish...

Petyr Baelish : Call me Petyr.

Sansa Stark : You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?

Lysa : Come here, Sansa.

Lysa : Do you know how far the fall is?

Sansa Stark : No.

Lysa : Neither do I, precisely. Hundreds of feet. It's fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height. The impact breaks them right apart. Like eggs dropped on the floor. Sometimes pieces remain intact. You'll find the head sitting on its own. Every hair in place. Blue eyes staring at nothing. I know what you did.

Sansa Stark : I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen-

Lysa : Don't be coy with me, you little whore. You kissed him. You kissed Petyr.

Sansa Stark : I didn't. You don't understand.

Lysa : I saw you! You can't lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.

Sansa Stark : He kissed me. I pulled away.

Lysa : Liar! Whore! He is mine!

Sansa Stark : Please!

Lysa : My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they're all dead. That's what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me. Look down! Look down! Look down! Look down!

Petyr Baelish : Lysa! Let her go.

Lysa : You want her? This empty-headed child?

Petyr Baelish : Let her go.

Lysa : She's just like her mother. She'll never love you. I lied for you. I killed for you. Why did you bring her here? Why?

Petyr Baelish : I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa.

Petyr Baelish : Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife.

Petyr Baelish : I have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. Your sister.

Man : Here we are.

Man : The Rains of Castamere!

Moles Town Whore : You fucking dick! Same wrong guess every fucking time. Listen, ya cunt.

Man : Oh, The Bear and the Maiden Fair!

Moles Town Whore : There's a man with an ear. Too bad you've got a hangnail for a cock. First time I saw you with your britches down, I thought you were a eunuch! You seen it girls. Like a baby snail peekin' out of his shell. *laughs and walks toward Gilly* *to Gilly* Your baby was crying this morning. It waked me up. You hear me?

Gilly : Yes.

Moles Town Whore : Well, what are you going to say?

Gilly : I'm sorry it woke you up.

Moles Town Whore : I don't care if you're sorry. Keep that baby quiet, or I will.

Gilly : Don't you ever touch him.

Moles Town Whore : Hehehe, little Wildling bitch. You shouldo ve stayed with your own kind. *an owl hoots in the distance* Are you listening to me?

Gilly : Shut your mouth.

Moles Town Whore : What? It's just an owl you dumb bitch.

Gilly : No it's not.

Sam : I should never have left her there.

Jon Snow : You couldn't have known.

Sam : Of course I couldo ve known. They were raiding the villages close by.

Grenn : And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers?

Ed : Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.

Grenn : Oh, so it's alright then?! Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?!

Ed : I didn't say it was alright! I'm sayin' they shouldn't have been there.

Grenn : We pledged to guard the realms of men.

Sam : She's dead because of me.

Grenn : We can't even guard Mole's Town.

Jon Snow : We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want.

Sam : Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.

Pyp : Maybe she managed to hide herself. I thought one of you was dead, you went North with Mormont and no one came back. Not for ages. But then you did.

Ed : She survived Craster and he was the worst shit I've ever met. She survived the long march to the wall. She survived a white walker for fuck's sake. She might've got out.

Sam : She might have.

Jon Snow : If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close.

Ed : A hundred thousand.

Grenn : And there's what, 5 of us left.

Ed : If you're counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully. A hundred and two.

Pyp : How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?

Ed : Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back.

Daenerys Targaryen : You think he was spying on you?

Missandei : No, not spying.

Daenerys Targaryen : The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.

Missandei : Yes your grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : But you are not Dothraki.

Missandei : No.

Daenerys Targaryen : Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes.

Missandei : He was interested.

Daenerys Targaryen : What?

Missandei : I believe he was interested.

Daenerys Targaryen : When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?

Missandei : All of it?

Daenerys Targaryen : The...the pillar an the stones.

Missandei : I don't know, your grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : Haven't you ever wondered?

Missandei : Yes, your grace.

Grey Worm : Missandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.

Missandei : in Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.

Grey Worm : in Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.

Missandei : in Valyrian* No.

Grey Worm : The lessons you give I in Common tongue, these are precious to I.

Missandei : To me.

Grey Worm : To me.

Missandei : I don't remember teaching you the word precious.

Grey Worm : Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...he teaches me this word.

Missandei : Do you remember the name you were given at birth?

Grey Worm : I remember nothing. Only unsullied.

Missandei : When they cut you, do you remember that?

Missandei : I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.

Grey Worm : Why? Why sorry?

Missandei : It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.

Grey Worm : approaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me, I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry.

Missandei : in Valyrian* Grey Worm.

Missandei : in Valyrian* I'm glad you saw me.

Grey Worm : in Valyrian* So am I.

Ramsay Bolton : Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?

Theon Greyjoy : I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands.

Ramsay Bolton : And what are you really?

Theon Greyjoy : I'm Reek.

Ramsay Bolton : Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud.

Ramsay Bolton : Until when?

Theon Greyjoy : Always. Forever.

Ramsay Bolton : That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.

Guard : to Theon* No closer. Who are you?

Ralf : I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?

Theon Greyjoy : Yes.

Ralf : And why should I believe that?

Theon Greyjoy : I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.

Everyone : What is dead may never die.

Ralf : And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?

Theon Greyjoy : Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.

Ralf : And what does Lord Bolton want?

Theon Greyjoy : You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.

Ralf : He wants us to surrender?

Theon Greyjoy : My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you.

Ralf : shame fought with honor.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm sorry, I didn't hear...

Ralf : No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?

Theon Greyjoy : scared* You don't know.

Ralf : The Ironborn will not surrender.

Theon Greyjoy : whispering* Reek. Reek.

Ralf : You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?

Theon Greyjoy : Reek.

Man : If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?

Theon Greyjoy : Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.

Ramsay Bolton : You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?

Theon Greyjoy : Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?

Ramsay Bolton : I believe we will. To our new home.

Petyr : A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally.

Lord Royce : Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.

Petyr : The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce.

Lord Royce : She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black.

Petyr : My lord...

Lord Royce : And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn...

Petyr : Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.

Lady Anya : Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair.

Petyr : Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.

Lady Anya : She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.

Lord Royce : Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door.

Petyr : She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.

Lord Royce : We were told there was a witness. A girl.

Lady Anya : A niece of yours, I believe.

Petyr : A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help.

Lord Royce : We'd like to speak with her.

Petyr : Let me fetch her.

Lady Anya : No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.

Lady Anya : Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room.

Petyr : My lady...

Lady Anya : I wasn't asking you.

Sansa Stark : He can stay.

Lord Royce : Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw.

Sansa Stark : to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything.

Lady Anya : Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.

Sansa Stark : My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall.

Lord Royce : Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?

Sansa Stark : Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name.

Ser Vance : Your secret is safe with us, my lady.

Lord Royce : Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.

Lady Anya : Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.

Sansa Stark : You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me.

Lord Royce : Lady Sansa.

Sansa Stark : It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*

Lady Anya : Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault.

Lord Royce : You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.

Lady Anya : Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.

Lord Royce : Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly.

Petyr : You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same.

Lady Anya : Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?

Petyr : For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl.

Lord Royce : Are you questioning our courage?

Petyr : I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?

Lord Royce : Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.

Petyr : No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?

Lady Anya : Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead.

Petyr : I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale.

Lady Anya : Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.

Petyr : And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.

Lady Anya : More often they die young.

Petyr : I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse.

Lord Royce : Aye, it's time.

Petyr : Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest.

Boy : Ser Barristan.

Ser Barristan : Yes? Who sent you?

Ser Jorah : Ser Barristan.

Ser Barristan : Ser Jorah.

Ser Jorah : Have I forgotten a council meeting?

Ser Barristan : No.

Ser Jorah : What's this?

Ser Barristan : A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.

Ser Jorah : Who gave you this?

Ser Barristan : Does it matter?

Ser Jorah : Have you told her?

Ser Barristan : I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back.

Ser Jorah : Let me speak with her in private.

Ser Barristan : You'll never be alone with her again.

Daenerys Targaryen : Why did the usurper pardon you?

Ser Jorah : If we could speak alone.

Daenerys Targaryen : No, speak to me here. Explain it to me.

Ser Jorah : Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him.

Daenerys Targaryen : The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.

Ser Jorah : It is not forged.

Daenerys Targaryen : Why, then?

Ser Jorah : I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing.

Daenerys Targaryen : What was the content of these letters?

Ser Jorah : Information.

Daenerys Targaryen : What information?

Ser Jorah : When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.

Daenerys Targaryen : You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?

Ser Jorah : I...

Daenerys Targaryen : Yes or no?

Ser Jorah : Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?

Ser Jorah : Yes.

Daenerys Targaryen : That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.

Ser Jorah : I stopped you from drinking his wine.

Daenerys Targaryen : Because you knew it was poisoned.

Ser Jorah : I suspected.

Daenerys Targaryen : You betrayed me from the first.

Ser Jorah : Forgive me. I never meant...please, Khaleesi, forgive me.

Daenerys Targaryen : You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...

Ser Jorah : I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.

Daenerys Targaryen : and you want me to forgive you?

Ser Jorah : I have loved you.

Daenerys Targaryen : Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can.

Ser Jorah : Daenerys, please.

Daenerys Targaryen : Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now.

Ramsay Bolton : Moat Cailin is yours, Father.

Lord Bolton : Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?

Ramsay Bolton : No.

Ramsay Bolton : Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see.

Ramsay Bolton : Moors, fields, hills.

Ramsay Bolton : Tell me what you see.

Ramsay Bolton : Nothing.

Roose : Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?

Ramsay Bolton : Ramsay Snow.

Roose : No, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North.

Ramsay Bolton : You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise.

Ramsay Bolton : Come, Reek, I'll be needing a bath.

Sansa Stark : Yes?

Petyr : First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?

Sansa Stark : They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.

Petyr : That's not an answer.

Sansa Stark : If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?

Petyr : I don't know.

Sansa Stark : Neither do I.

Petyr : Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?

Sansa Stark : I know what you want.

Petyr : Do you?

Sandor Clegane : I thought it'd make me happy, but it doesn't. Not really. Nothing makes you happy.

Arya Stark : Lots of things make me happy.

Sandor Clegane : Like what?

Arya Stark : Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.

Sandor Clegane : So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?

Arya Stark : At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.

Sandor Clegane : Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.

Arya Stark : You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?

Sandor Clegane : I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel.

Arya Stark : That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.

Sandor Clegane : laughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*

Arya Stark : You should have let me burn it.

Sandor Clegane : It's a fleabite.

Arya Stark : That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.

Sandor Clegane : Well, we won't have to walk too much further.

Arya Stark : You really think my aunt will pay for me?

Sandor Clegane : Aye, she'll pay.

Arya Stark : I've never even met her.

Sandor Clegane : Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about.

Arya Stark : I'm not a lady.

Guard : Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

Sandor Clegane : The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn.

Guard : Then I offer my condolences. Lady Arryn died. Three days ago.

Robin : I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave.

Petyr : You shouldn't be.

Robin : The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside.

Petyr : It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.

Sansa Stark : Shall we go?

Tyrion Lannister : Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?

Jaime Lannister : Soon.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?

Jaime Lannister : I've never seen him fight.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die.

Jaime Lannister : Oberyn believes in himself.

Tyrion Lannister : That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?

Jaime Lannister : Beheading.

Tyrion Lannister : Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.

Jaime Lannister : Cousins.

Tyrion Lannister : Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?

Jaime Lannister : Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.

Tyrion Lannister : Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.

Together : Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!

Tyrion Lannister : Nothing made him happier.

Jaime Lannister : Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.

Tyrion Lannister : On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.

Jaime Lannister : The joke wore thin, though.

Tyrion Lannister : For you. You drifted away.

Jaime Lannister : I had other interests.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson.

Jaime Lannister : Why?

Tyrion Lannister : I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. "Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?" He gave me an answer. "Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library.

Jaime Lannister : Volarik. Tried to touch me once.

Tyrion Lannister : Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of "khuu, khuu, khuu". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard "khuu, khuu, khuu" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.

Jaime Lannister : Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?

Tyrion Lannister : I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once.

Jaime Lannister : He was twice your size.

Tyrion Lannister : He just pushed me aside with a "khuu" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?

Jaime Lannister : I don't know.

Jaime Lannister : Good luck today.

Tyrion Lannister : Looks like very light armor.

Oberyn Martell : I like to move around.

Tyrion Lannister : You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.

Oberyn Martell : You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.

Tyrion Lannister : It could get you killed. It could get me killed.

Oberyn Martell : Today is not the day I die.

Ellaria : You're going to fight that?

Oberyn Martell : I'm going to kill that.

Ellaria : He is the biggest man I've ever seen.

Oberyn Martell : Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.

Tyrion Lannister : Thank the gods.

Pycell : In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion...

Ellaria : Don't leave me alone in this world.

Oberyn Martell : Never.

Oberyn Martell : Have they told you who I am?

Mountain : Some dead man.

Oberyn Martell : I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.

Oberyn Martell : I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.

Oberyn Martell : Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.

Oberyn Martell : You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!

Oberyn Martell : You raped her! You murdered her!

Oberyn Martell : You killed her children!

Oberyn Martell : Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!

Mountain : Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!

Tywin Lannister : standing up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death.

Sam : What was she like?

Jon Snow : She...she had red hair.

Sam : Oh? How big were her feet?

Jon Snow : Well what do you want me to say?

Sam : I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.

Jon Snow : So you and Gilly never-

Sam : No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.

Jon Snow : But if she had, you wouldo ve? You'd have broken your vows?

Sam : The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women.

Jon Snow : What?

Sam : I shall take no wife" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. "I shall father no children" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation.

Jon Snow : I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.

Sam : Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?

Jon Snow : It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!

Sam : No, you're really not.

Jon Snow : And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.

Sam : There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.

Jon Snow : There will.

Sam : They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.

Jon Snow : Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch.

Tormund : Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?

Ygritte : Yes.

Tormund : Oh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many's the man who--

Ygritte : I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.

Tormund : We could be waiting here a while.

Ygritte : Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting.

Styr : You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.

Ygritte : Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon.

Styr : Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.

Ygritte : I probably killed him already.

Styr : So you've said.

Ygritte : And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.

Styr : And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.

Ygritte : What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?

Styr : Maybe I have.

Ygritte : Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me.

Aemon : And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?

Sam : Maester Aemon. How did you know-

Aemon : That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?

Sam : Let me help you.

Aemon : Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?

Sam : Maester Faull

Aemon : Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library.

Sam : But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.

Aemon : Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.

Sam : I don't love her.

Aemon : Yes you do.

Sam : No.

Aemon : Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.

Sam : You were?

Aemon : You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?

Sam : I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that.

Aemon : You know who I was before I came here? What I couldo ve been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.

Sam : Who was she?

Aemon : Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.

Pyp : I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!

Gilly : They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please!

Pyp : I'm sorry, I can't.

Gilly : If they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do.

Sam : Pyp! Open the gate.

Pyp : I can't.

Gilly : Sam, is that you?!

Sam : Yes!

Pyp : Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.

Sam : Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!

Pyp : I've never heard you curse before.

Sam : Yes, well, best get used to it.

Sam : Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella.

Gilly : It was horrible.

Sam : I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.

Gilly : Don't let them send me away, Sam.

Sam : Never.

Gilly : I know there's no women allowed.

Sam : Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too.

Alliser : Get ready!

Thenn Warg : It's time.

Janos : Pick up the pace!

Jon Snow : There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser.

Alliser : A hundred thousand you say?

Jon Snow : Yes sir.

Alliser : You can say it if you like. We shouldo ve sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.

Jon Snow : It was a difficult decision either way, Ser.

Alliser : Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job.

Sam : You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.

Gilly : You're leaving me again?

Sam : I'm not leaving you!

Gilly : You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together.

Sam : I...I didn't mean in the same room.

Gilly : What are you going to do out there?

Sam : Help my brothers.

Gilly : How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.

Sam : I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.

Gilly : Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here.

Sam : Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do.

Gilly : Promise me you won't die.

Sam : I promise you I won't die.

Sam : There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.

Pyp : I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?

Sam : Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us.

Pyp : Well if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?

Sam : I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid.

Pyp : But you're afraid now?

Sam : Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore.

Ygritte : Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.

Styr : How high are the walls?

Ygritte : Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened.

Tormund : Let's kill some Crows!

Tormund : yells* Come on! *puts out the fire*

Alliser : Archers knock, everyone else hold.

Alliser : I said knock and hold you cunts! Does knock mean draw?!

Nights Watch : No Ser!

Alliser : Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?!

Alliser : You all plan to die here tonight?

Alliser : That's very good to hear. Draw!

Member : Help, down below.

Janos : They're attacking the southern gates!

Alliser : Now?

Janos : Now!

Alliser : I'm going down then. Brother Slynt, you have The Wall.

Janos : What?!

Alliser : What are you fucking waiting for, loose!

Janos : You heard the man. Loose!

Tormund : You, over there.

Sam : Did you get one?

Pyp : No. Ah shit, Pyp. Shit. Sam.

Sam : Yeah?

Pyp : I think we're gonna die.

Sam : If you keep missing we will.

Alliser : Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?

Nights Watch : No!

Alliser : Tonight we fight. And when the sun rises I promise you, Castle Black will stand.

Alliser : The Night's Watch will stand.

Alliser : With me now! Now, with me!

Janos : No discipline. No training. Gang of thieves, that's all this is. I commanded the city watch of King's Landing. Those men obeyed orders.

Jon Snow : We can't just let them attack the gate!

Janos : The bars of those gates are four inches of cold, rolled steel.

Jon Snow : Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?

Janos : No such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.

Grenn : Brother Slynt! I've just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below. You're the most experienced man he's got, he said he needs ya.

Janos : Needed below? Yes. Yes.

Jon Snow : Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!

Jon Snow : They won't summit before dawn.

Grenn : How do you know that?

Jon Snow : Because I've made that claim.

Ed : I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.

Jon Snow : Knock! Draw! Loose!

Pyp : I got one. Right through the heart, he's dead.

Sam : Oh, is it over?

Pyp : Huh?

Sam : Well then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*

Sam : You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester Aemon is coming, he's gonna make it alright.

Jon Snow : Now!

Ed : Now!

Jon Snow : to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate.

Grenn : Alright.

Jon Snow : grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...

Grenn : They won't. Come on Hill! And you Cooper! You three, on me! Come on you lazy bastards!

Jon Snow : Oil!

Ed : Oil on the ramp!

Alliser : Protect the gate!

Alliser : Hold the fucking gate! Hold it!

Sam : to Grenn* We need more men down here.

Grenn : We have to hold the gate.

Sam : But we need men here.

Grenn : Tell Jon! He's in command. *to the men behind him* Let's go!

Sam : to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!

Sam : Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?

Sam : And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!

Jon Snow : What are you doing up here?

Sam : The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.

Jon Snow : Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them.

Jon Snow : Two brothers now fight with me.

Ed : Might as well enjoy our last night, right boys? Light the fuckers up. Knock! Draw! Loose!

Donnel : How are we gonna stop that?

Cooper : We shot twenty-eight arrows in him already.

Grenn : You heard Jon, we hold the gate.

Donnel : Jon Snow's not Lord Commander.

Grenn : We hold the gate!

Donnel : Mother save me. Father save me.

Grenn : The gods aren't down here. It's the six of us, you hear me?

Donnel : No, please.

Grenn : Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns

All Together : And win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come!

Jon Snow : to Sam* I don't want you out there.

Sam : You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.

Jon Snow : I need him more than I need you.

Sam : We need you boy.

Ygritte : Jon Snow.

Jon Snow : No, shh, don't talk.

Ygritte : Do you remember that cave?

Ygritte : We shouldo ve stayed in that cave.

Jon Snow : We'll go back there.

Ygritte : You know nothing, Jon Snow.

Ed : Drop the scythe, boys!

Ed : Hoister up!

Ed : They've had enough for one night.

Ed : Don't cheer too loud. They still outnumber us a thousand to one.

Jon Snow : Tormund. It's over, let it end.

Tormund : This is how a man ends.

Jon Snow : Put him in chains. We'll question him later.

Tormund : I shouldo ve thrown you from the top of your wall boy!

Jon Snow : Aye, you shouldo ve.

Sam : Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?

Sam : We held them off.

Jon Snow : For one night.

Sam : This is a great victory.

Jon Snow : Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them.

Sam : Where are you going?

Jon Snow : I'm going to find Mance.

Sam : To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.

Jon Snow : Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home.

Sam : Without Mance? You're going to kill him?

Jon Snow : I'm going to try.

Sam : They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him.

Jon Snow : He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.

Sam : He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!

Jon Snow : You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?

Jon Snow : They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out.

Sam : What are you doing?

Jon Snow : I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.

Sam : Jon. Come back.

Mance : You're wearing a black cloak again.

Jon Snow : I've been sent to negotiate with you.

Mance : It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was.

Jon Snow : The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows.

Mance : All of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?

Jon Snow : She put three arrows in me when I escaped.

Mance : Did you see her again at Castle Black?

Jon Snow : Yes.

Mance : And?

Jon Snow : She's dead.

Mance : Your doing?

Jon Snow : No.

Mance : We'll drink to her.

Mance : Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last.

Mance : Ygritte.

Jon Snow : Ygritte.

Jon Snow : That's not wine.

Mance : No, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty.

Jon Snow : He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.

Mance : He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.

Jon Snow : Grenn came from a farm.

Mance : Mag and Grenn.

Jon Snow : Grenn and Mag.

Mance : Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?

Jon Snow : Turn your army around and go home.

Mance : You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?

Jon Snow : I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.

Mance : I showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black.

Mance : Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?

Mance : You attacking us?

Jon Snow : No, it's like you said, we don't have the men.

Mance : Hold! To me. To me.

Mance : Stand down! I said my people have bled enough and I meant it.

Stannis Baratheon : You're the king beyond the wall?

Stannis Baratheon : You know who I am?

Mance : Never had the pleasure.

Davos : This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms.

Mance : We're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.

Stannis Baratheon : It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.

Mance : We do not kneel.

Stannis Baratheon : I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king.

Mance : All the same, we do not kneel.

Stannis Baratheon : Take these men away.

Davos : What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?

Jon Snow : I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.

Davos : You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.

Jon Snow : I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son.

Stannis Baratheon : Your father was an honorable man.

Jon Snow : He was, your grace.

Stannis Baratheon : What do you think he'd have done with him?

Jon Snow : I was this man's prisoner once. He couldo ve tortured me, he couldo ve killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father wouldo ve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say.

Stannis Baratheon : Very well. *to Davos* Take him.

Jon Snow : Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them.

Pycelle : I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate.

Cersei Lannister : Bloody Martells.

Pycelle : The cause appears to be manticore venom.

Qyburn : It is, yes, manticore.

Pycelle : I've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done.

Qyburn : Yes there is.

Pycelle : May I ask what you think you're doing?

Qyburn : Saving him.

Pycelle : Your grace. I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester.

Qyburn : That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.

Pycelle : That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so in my opinion.

Cersei Lannister : You're dismissed, Grand Maester.

Pycelle : Your grace. This is my laboratory!

Cersei Lannister : Not anymore.

Cersei Lannister : You can save him?

Qyburn : Difficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide. We stand a chance.

Cersei Lannister : Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.

Qyburn : Thank you, your grace. You should know, the process may change him, somewhat.

Cersei Lannister : Will it weaken him?

Qyburn : Oh no.

Cersei Lannister : Very well then.

Tywin Lannister : Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed.

Cersei Lannister : I'm opening it again.

Tywin Lannister : You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.

Cersei Lannister : I will not.

Tywin Lannister : Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was.

Cersei Lannister : I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king.

Tywin Lannister : When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-

Cersei Lannister : I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.

Tywin Lannister : Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?

Cersei Lannister : When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away.

Tywin Lannister : No.

Cersei Lannister : Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen.

Tywin Lannister : And how will you do that?

Cersei Lannister : I'll tell everyone the truth.

Tywin Lannister : And what truth would that be?

Cersei Lannister : You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you wouldo ve known.

Tywin Lannister : Known what?

Cersei Lannister : Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me.

Tywin Lannister : No, no, no, no, no.

Cersei Lannister : Your legacy is a lie.

Tywin Lannister : I don't believe you.

Cersei Lannister : Yes you do.

Cersei Lannister : Jaime.

Jaime Lannister : You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?

Cersei Lannister : For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine.

Jaime Lannister : Tyrion is your family.

Cersei Lannister : He's not.

Jaime Lannister : You don't get to choose.

Cersei Lannister : I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-

Jaime Lannister : Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.

Cersei Lannister : A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?

Jaime Lannister : The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-

Cersei Lannister : I choose you.

Jaime Lannister : Those are words.

Cersei Lannister : Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.

Jaime Lannister : Told him what?

Cersei Lannister : I told him about us.

Jaime Lannister : You told him?

Cersei Lannister : I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you.

Jaime Lannister : You think he'll just accept that?

Cersei Lannister : Go and ask him.

Jaime Lannister : What did you say?

Cersei Lannister : I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters.

Jaime Lannister : Someone will walk in.

Cersei Lannister : I don't care.

Missandei : in Valyrian* You stand before Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Mereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men. Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.

Fennesz : in Valyrian* Thank you for seeing me, your grace. My name is Fennesz. I can speak the common tongue if you wish.

Daenerys Targaryen : You speak it very well.

Fennesz : Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his children. I taught them languages and history. They know a great deal about your family because of me. Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much.

Daenerys Targaryen : I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?

Fennesz : When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house. But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must. So I lost my home. Now I live on the streets.

Daenerys Targaryen : I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.

Fennesz : I do not mean to offend, your grace. I went to one of these places. The young prey on the old. Take what they want and beat us if we resist.

Daenerys Targaryen : My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you.

Fennesz : Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher. I had the respect and love of these children.

Daenerys Targaryen : What is it that you want from me?

Fennesz : Your grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.

Daenerys Targaryen : You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?

Fennesz : Please, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world you've built for them. But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same-

Daenerys Targaryen : I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.

Fennesz : Thank you, your grace. Thank you.

Barristan : The masters will take advantage of this situation. The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.

Daenerys Targaryen : Approach my friend.

Man : in Low Valyrian* I do not understand, my queen. I do not understand, my queen.

Missandei : in Low Valyrian* The Queen says you may approach.

Man : crying, speaking Low Valyrian*

Missandei : translating* I have brought you. He came from the sky. The black one. The winged shadow. He came from the sky and...

Missandei : translating* My girl. My little girl.

Daenerys Targaryen : What was her name?

Missandei : Zala, your grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : How old was she?

Missandei : Three.

Daenerys Targaryen : Three. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon?

Grey Worm : in Valyrian* Sailors saw him flying over the Black Cliffs three days ago, my queen. Nothing since then.

Daenerys Targaryen : in Valyrian* Meet me in the catacombs.

Aemon : They came to us from White Harbor and Barrowton, from Fairmarket and King's Landing, from north and south, from east and west. They died protecting men, women, and children who will never know their names. It is for us to remember them. Our brothers, we shall never see their like again.

All Together : And now their watch is ended.

Aemon : And now their watch is ended.

Tormund : Your old blind man patched me up. Why?

Jon Snow : He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe.

Tormund : You want me alive so you can torture me?

Jon Snow : No one's going to torture you.

Tormund : So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the wall?

Jon Snow : I don't know what happens to the prisoners.

Tormund : Who decides?

Jon Snow : I suppose Stannis does.

Tormund : He your king now?

Jon Snow : I don't have a king.

Tormund : You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow. You can never be a kneeler again.

Jon Snow : We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?

Tormund : Words? What kind of words?

Jon Snow : Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.

Tormund : Do what?

Jon Snow : Say farewell.

Tormund : The dead can't hear us, boy.

Tormund : Snow. Did you love her? She loved you.

Jon Snow : She told you?

Tormund : No. All she ever talked about was killing you. That's how I know. She belongs in the North. The real North. You understand me?

Meera : We can stop, we can rest.

Jojen : We'll rest with the three-eyed raven.

Meera : We're not going to make it.

Jojen : We're already here.

Bran Stark : Jojen. Jojen! Look, Jojen, look.

Meera : JOJEN! Hold on!

Bran Stark : Help them! Now!

Meera : Hold on to me!

Hodor : Hodor...

Bran Stark : Help them!

Jojen : Bran! Save yourself, now!

Girl : Come with me, Brandon Stark!

Girl : He is lost. Come with me, or die with him.

Jojen : Go with them.

Girl : They cannot follow us. The power that moves them is powerless here.

Bran Stark : Who are you?

Girl : The First Men called us The Children, but we were born long before them. Come, he waits for you.

Bran Stark : You're the three-eyed raven.

Old Man : I have been many things. Now, I am what you see.

Meera : My brother, he led us to you, and now he.

Old Man : He knew what would happen. From the moment he left, he knew, and he went anyway.

Meera : How do you know?

Old Man : I've been watching you. All of you, all of your lives, with a thousand eyes and one. Now you've come to me at last, Brandon Stark, though the hour is late.

Bran Stark : I didn't want anyone to die for me.

Old Man : He died so that you could find what you have lost.

Bran Stark : You're going to help me walk again?

Old Man : You'll never walk again. But you will fly.

Brienne : Podrick. Podrick! Where are the horses?

Podrick : I hobbled them last night.

Brienne : What sort of hobble?

Podrick : A figure-eight, like you taught me.

Brienne : If you did it like I taught you then the horses would be here.

Podrick : Thieves, maybe?

Brienne : It's at least thirty miles to the Eyrie from here. You're carrying the saddle bags.

Arya Stark : People coming. You can shit later, there's people coming!

Brienne : Morning!

Arya Stark : Morning.

Brienne : I like your sword. Are we getting close to the bloody gate?

Arya Stark : About ten more miles.

Brienne : Did you hear that Podrick? Only about ten more miles to the Bloody Gate.

Arya Stark : Are you a knight?

Brienne : No.

Arya Stark : But you know how to use that sword.

Brienne : I do.

Arya Stark : Does it have a name?

Brienne : Oathkeeper."�

Arya Stark : Mine's "Needle."�

Brienne : Good name.

Arya Stark : Who taught you how to fight?

Brienne : My father.

Arya Stark : Mine never wanted to. Said fighting was for boys.

Brienne : Mine said the same. But I kept fighting the boys anyway. Kept losing. Finally my father said, "If you're going to do it, you might as well do it right."�

Brienne : Seven blessings. I'm Brienne of Tarth, this is Podrick Payne.

Sandor Clegane : You want something?

Podrick : That's Sandor Clegane- the Hound.

Brienne : You're Arya Stark.

Sandor Clegane : I asked if you wanted something.

Brienne : I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.

Arya Stark : My mother's dead.

Brienne : I know. I wish I couldo ve been there to protect her.

Arya Stark : You're not a northerner.

Brienne : I know, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her.

Arya Stark : Why didn't you?

Brienne : She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to King's Landing.

Sandor Clegane : You're paid by the Lannisters. You're here for the bounty on me.

Brienne : I'm not paid by the Lannisters.

Sandor Clegane : No? Fancy sword you've got there. Where'd you get it? I've been looking at Lannister gold all my life. Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth, tell me that's not Lannister gold.

Brienne : Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.

Arya Stark : The Bloody Gate's ten miles.

Brienne : I swore to your mother by the Old Gods and the New -

Arya Stark : I don't care what you swore!

Brienne : Arya!

Sandor Clegane : You heard the girl! She's not coming with you.

Brienne : She is.

Sandor Clegane : You're not a good listener. Valyrian steel-- I've always wanted some Valyrian steel.

Brienne : Come with me Arya. I'll take you to safety.

Sandor Clegane : Safety?! Where the fuck's that? Her aunt in the Eyrie's dead. Her mother's dead, her father's dead, her brother's dead. Winterfell's a pile of rubble. There's no safety, you dumb bitch. If you don't know that by now, you're the wrong one to watch over her.

Brienne : And that's what you're doing? Watching over her?

Sandor Clegane : Aye, that's what I'm doing.

Brienne : I have no wish to kill you Ser.

Sandor Clegane : I'm not a knight.

Brienne : Arya! Arya! ARYA! Where is she?

Podrick : She was just here...

Brienne : Why weren't you watching her?

Podrick : I was watching you I thought you migth need some help.

Brienne : Which way Pod? Which way did she go?

Podrick : Ah, I think that way.

Sandor Clegane : You're still here? [Coughs] Big bitch saved you.

Arya Stark : I don't need saving.

Sandor Clegane : No, not you. You're a real killer. With your water dancing, and your needle.

Arya Stark : You're gonna die?

Sandor Clegane : Unless there's a Maester hiding behind that rock, aye, I'm done. I'd skin you alive for wine. [Arya offers water.] Fuck water! Killed by a woman. I bet you liked that. Go on, go after her. She'll help you. Going out alone, you won't last a day out there.

Arya Stark : I'll last longer than you.

Sandor Clegane : You remember where the heart is? Fuck it. I'm ready. Go on, girl. Another name off your list. You kept promising me. I cut down your butcher's boy, the ginger. He was begging for mercy. Please sir, please don't kill me, please, please. Bled all over my horse. Saddle stunk of butcher's boy for weeks. And your sister, your pretty sister. I shouldo ve taken her. That night the Blackwater burned, I shouldo ve fucked her bloody. At least I'd have one happy memory! Do I have to beg you? Do it. Do it.

Sandor Clegane : Kill me. Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, get on with it you son of a whore.

Jaime Lannister : Is that any way to speak about our mother?

Tyrion Lannister : What're you doing?

Jaime Lannister : What do you think I'm doing? The galley's waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.

Tyrion Lannister : Who's helping you?

Jaime Lannister : Varys.

Tyrion Lannister : Varys?

Jaime Lannister : You have more friends than you thought.

Jaime Lannister : There's a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, and then twice again. Varys will open.

Tyrion Lannister : I suppose this is goodbye, then.

Jaime Lannister : Farewell, little brother.

Tyrion Lannister : Jaime, thank you. For my life.

Jaime Lannister : Quickly now.

Woman : Tywin. my lion...

Tyrion Lannister : I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Tywin Lannister : Tyrion! Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Ah, your brother ,I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we'll go and talk in my chambers. Is this how you want to speak to me? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure.

Tyrion Lannister : All my life, you've wanted me dead.

Tywin Lannister : Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for what's yours. I'd never let them execute you; is that what you fear? I'd never let Illyn Payne take your head. You're a Lannister. You're my son.

Tyrion Lannister : I loved her.

Tywin Lannister : Who?

Tyrion Lannister : Shae.

Tywin Lannister : Bah, Tyrion. Put down that crossbow.

Tyrion Lannister : I murdered her. With my own hands.

Tywin Lannister : It doesn't matter.

Tyrion Lannister : It doesn't matter?

Tywin Lannister : She was a whore!

Tyrion Lannister : Say that word again.

Tywin Lannister : And what? You'll kill your own father in the privy? No. You're my son. Enough of this nonsense.

Tyrion Lannister : I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn't poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?

Tywin Lannister : Enough. We'll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.

Tyrion Lannister : I can't go back there. She's in there.

Tywin Lannister : What, are you afraid of a dead whore?

Tywin Lannister : You shot me. You're no son of mine.

Tyrion Lannister : I am your son. I have always been your son.

Varys : What have you done? Quickly. Trust me, my friend, I've brought you this far.

Arya Stark : I want to see the captain.

Captain : You're seeing him.

Arya Stark : I want to go north, to the wall.

Captain : No you don't.

Arya Stark : I can pay.

Captain : There is nothing in the north but ice and war and pirates.

Arya Stark : I wouldn't need a cabin. Please, I could work, scrubbing the floors, or.

Captain : I'm not going north, child, we're going home.

Arya Stark : Where's home?

Captain : The Free City of Braavos.

Arya Stark : Wait, I have something else.

Captain : More silver won't make a difference.

Arya Stark : It's not silver, it's iron.

Arya Stark : Valar morghulis.

Captain : How did you. valar dohaeris. Of course, you shall have a cabin.

Melara : We shouldn't be out here alone.

Cersei Lannister : Why not?

Melara : If your father hears.

Cersei Lannister : He'll never know we've been gone.

Melara : But if he finds out.

Cersei Lannister : You don't need to be afraid of my father.

Melara : Are you sure?

Cersei Lannister : Yes.

Melara : We shouldn't go in.

Cersei Lannister : Of course we should.

Maggy : Get out. Get out!

Melara : Let's go.

Cersei Lannister : No.

Maggy : Listen to your friend.

Cersei Lannister : They said that you were terrifying. With cat's teeth and three eyes. You're not terrifying. You're boring.

Maggy : You don't know what I am.

Cersei Lannister : I know you're a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.

Maggy : Everybody wants to know their future. Until they know their future.

Cersei Lannister : This is my father's land. My land. Tell me my future or I'll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.

Maggy : Your blood. Give me a taste.

Maggy : Three questions you get. You won't like the answers.

Cersei Lannister : I've been promised to the prince. When will we marry?

Maggy : You'll never wed the prince. You'll wed the king.

Cersei Lannister : But I will be queen?

Maggy : Oh yes, you'll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear.

Cersei Lannister : Will the king and I have children?

Maggy : No. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3.

Cersei Lannister : That doesn't make sense.

Maggy : Gold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds.

Melara : Come on, we have to go. We have to go! Cersei!

Priest : Your grace, we are honored by your presence. The mourners are waiting.

Cersei Lannister : They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.

Priest : But your grace, many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here.

Priest : From all seven kingdoms.

Cersei Lannister : They will wait.

Cersei Lannister : He never wanted you to be a King's Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body.

Jaime Lannister : What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They're going to try to take it away, all of it.

Cersei Lannister : They?

Jaime Lannister : All of them out there are enemies. They're waiting a night to make sure he's really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they'll set to work on tearing us apart.

Cersei Lannister : They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he's the enemy. I've been telling you for years, you've been defending him for years.

Jaime Lannister : This is exactly what they want.

Cersei Lannister : and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?

Cersei Lannister : Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You're a man of action, aren't you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world.

Varys : Apologies.

Tyrion Lannister : I still don't see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.

Varys : I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that "fucking crate"�.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?

Varys : No. I only know what it's like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.

Tyrion Lannister : Pentos?

Varys : The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself.

Tyrion Lannister : Much better.

Varys : My lord?

Tyrion Lannister : I don't think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.

Varys : You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.

Tyrion Lannister : In a box. Why stop now?

Varys : Because we are talking about the future of our country.

Tyrion Lannister : The future is shit. Just like the past.

Prostitute : You want the same? Same as always?

White Rat : You. you don't have to.

Prostitute : Habit.

Daenerys Targaryen : Sons of the Harpy?

Barristan : Yes, your grace. They left it on the body.

Daenerys Targaryen : They've never killed before.

Barristan : It was only a matter of time, your grace. Conquerors are always met with resistance.

Daenerys Targaryen : I didn't conquer them. Their own people did.

Mossador : They do not see us as people, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?

Grey Worm : White Rat, your grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.

Barristan : The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message.

Mossador : Make them very angry.

Daenerys Targaryen : Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.

Missandei : Torgo Nudho.

Grey Worm : Missandei hin Naath.

Missandei : I wanted to speak with you.

Grey Worm : Why do you come?

Missandei : White Rat, the Unsullied who. I have heard they found his body in a brothel. I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereen's brothels. May I ask you why? Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel?

Grey Worm : I do not know. I must go.

Jon Snow : Get your shield up.

Olly : It's too heavy.

Jon Snow : If it wasn't heavy it wouldn't stop a sword, now get it up.

Jon Snow : Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I'll ring your head like a bell.

Gilly : Shouldn't you be training, too?

Sam : Well, I'm hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they've killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!

Alliser : These men need a firm hand. Always have. They're poachers and thieves.

Alliser : Not soldiers.

Gilly : That one hates me.

Sam : If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander. he hates the wildlings.

Sam : All the wildlings.

Gilly : Don't let them send us away.

Sam : It's not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he's a good man. He's running against Ser Alliser--

Gilly : Sam! Don't let them send us away.

Sam : I told you. Wherever you go, I go, too.

Gilly : You can't leave, they'll execute you.

Jon Snow : Good, good, pivot! Don't forget to pivot! Shield up!

Melisandre : The king wants a word.

Jon Snow : You're not cold, my lady?

Melisandre : Never. The Lordo s fire lives within me, Jon Snow.

Melisandre : Feel.

Melisandre : Are you a virgin?

Jon Snow : No.

Melisandre : Good.

Melisandre : Your grace. The bastard of Winterfell.

Stannis Baratheon : You know who rules at Winterfell now?

Jon Snow : Roose Bolton.

Stannis Baratheon : The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. Don't you want to avenge him?

Jon Snow : I want a great many things, your grace. But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now.

Davos : I've been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.

Jon Snow : They're good men.

Davos : Many don't. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?

Jon Snow : It's where she belonged.

Davos : Some of the Night's Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.

Jon Snow : They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn't make them monsters.

Stannis Baratheon : No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can't protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike. But if I'm to take Winterfell I'll need more men.

Jon Snow : The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part--

Stannis Baratheon : I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch. I'm talking about the wildlings.

Jon Snow : Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?

Stannis Baratheon : If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them. We'll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I'll declare them citizens of the realm. I'll give them land to live on.

Davos : It's a fair offer. More than fair.

Stannis Baratheon : I'll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.

Jon Snow : I don't think that's likely.

Stannis Baratheon : You admire him, don't you?

Jon Snow : I respect him.

Stannis Baratheon : He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...

Jon Snow : Your grace.

Stannis Baratheon : or he burns.

Jon Snow : How much time do I have?

Stannis Baratheon : Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow.

Master Of Arms : Sword up! Attack, my lord! Attack! Don't cross your feet!

Yohn Royce : My sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk. This one.

Petyr Baelish : Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.

Royce : Great warrior? He sings a sword like a girl with palsy.

Squire : My lord.

Master Of Arms : Sword up, my lord!

Petyr Baelish : Some boys develop more slowly. He's still young.

Royce : He's 13. Boys go to war at 13.

Petyr Baelish : He has other gifts.

Royce : Does he?

Petyr Baelish : The gift of a great name. Sometimes that's all one needs.

Sansa Stark : Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you've done for me.

Royce : I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady.

Petyr Baelish : I have no doubt that upon my return, Robin's skills will have improved immeasurably.

Royce : He'll be safe here. As for his skills, I make no promises.

Podrick : Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black. We're a few days ride from the Kingsroad, but that will take us--

Brienne : Us? The only reason you're here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital. You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You're safe.

Podrick : But I'm you're squire.

Brienne : Do you even know what a squire is?

Podrick : An attendant to a knight?

Brienne : I'm not a knight. That means you're not a squire.

Podrick : Well, where would I go?

Brienne : I don't care, I'm not your mother.

Podrick : You swore to find the Stark girls.

Brienne : I found Arya. She didn't want my protection.

Podrick : Sansa still might.

Brienne : Will you shut your mouth? I didn't ask for advice. I don't want anyone following me. I'm not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.

Sansa Stark : You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.

Petyr Baelish : I did.

Sansa Stark : But we're heading west.

Petyr Baelish : We are.

Sansa Stark : If he wanted to betray us, he already would have.

Petyr Baelish : Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he's not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?

Sansa Stark : No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?

Petyr Baelish : No. But I pay them well, and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me.

Sansa Stark : So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?

Petyr Baelish : So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can't get her hands on you.

Loras : It was such a deep, deep shock to us all. Your father was a force to be reckoned with. He truly was. I wouldn't presume to claim to have known him as such.

Loras : But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with. What a. what a force to be reckoned with.

Cersei Lannister : Thank you so much for your kind words.

Grand Maester Pyrcelle : Deepest condolences, your grace. This tragedy. I never trusted Varys. I often warned.

Lancel Lannister : Your grace.

Cersei Lannister : Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.

Lancel : My deepest sympathies.

Kevan Lannister : I apologize for my son's appearance.

Cersei Lannister : Uncle, it's quite alright.

Kevan : They call themselves sparrows. Bloody fanatics. Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point. They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive.

Cersei Lannister : I'm sure he'll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.

Kevan : Of course.

Cersei Lannister : Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.

Lancel : It wasn't my wounds that needed healing.

Cersei Lannister : What can I do for you?

Lancel : You can forgive me.

Cersei Lannister : What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?

Lancel : I led you into the darkness.

Cersei Lannister : I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.

Lancel : I tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king. His boar hunt. His wine.

Cersei Lannister : I don't know what you're talking about.

Lancel : I'm a different person now. I found peace in the light of the Seven. You can too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy. or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your father's soul.

Cersei Lannister : The day Tywin Lannister's soul needs your help.

Olyvar : It looks like Dorne.

Loras : No it doesn't.

Olyvar : It does. That's the Sunspear bit right there. And that's where the mountains are. And over here is. Sunsnake? Stonespear?

Loras : Sandstone.

Olyvar : Yes. Yes, Sandstone. Just there.

Loras : Fine.

Loras : It's Dorne.

Olyvar : We should go there. I think we would have a lovely time.

Loras : Judging by my experience, that would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden. Anywhere but here.

Margaery Tyrell : We're late for dinner as it is.

Loras : You're very respectful.

Margaery Tyrell : I'm very hungry.

Margaery Tyrell : What's your name?

Olyvar : Olyvar, my lady.

Margaery Tyrell : I'm afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar.

Margaery Tyrell : Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?

Loras : Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What's the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?

Margaery Tyrell : In any event. you shouldn't keep your intended waiting.

Loras : My intended? Please. Tywin's dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.

Margaery Tyrell : Lucky you.

Loras : Unlucky you.

Margaery Tyrell : You think I want that woman married to my brother?

Loras : If she doesn't marry me, she doesn't go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in King's Landing. Which means you're trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law.

Margaery Tyrell : Perhaps.

Loras : Perhaps?

Margaery Tyrell : Perhaps?

Tyrion Lannister : Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers.

Varys : Imp, half-man.

Varys : There are faster ways to kill yourself.

Tyrion Lannister : Not for a coward.

Varys : You are many things, my friend, but not a coward.

Tyrion Lannister : You never told me why you set me free.

Varys : Your brother asked me to.

Tyrion Lannister : You could have said no.

Varys : Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.

Tyrion Lannister : Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You're not family, you owe me nothing.

Varys : I didn't do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.

Tyrion Lannister : A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.

Varys : I don't believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.

Tyrion Lannister : You're going to have to find another soldier. I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.

Varys : You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not well-suited for work.

Varys : I think you are. You have your father's instinct for politics, and you have compassion.

Tyrion Lannister : Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.

Varys : I never said you were perfect.

Tyrion Lannister : What is it you want exactly?

Varys : Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.

Tyrion Lannister : Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that's how they became powerful in the first place.

Varys : Perhaps. And perhaps we've grown so used to horror we assume there's no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?

Tyrion Lannister : I will never sit on the Iron Throne.

Varys : No, you won't. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name.

Tyrion Lannister : Good luck finding him.

Varys : Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for.

Tyrion Lannister : Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?

Daario Naharis : When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven't been behaving themselves.

Hizdahr Zo Loraq : The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review.

Daenerys Targaryen : Good.

Hizdahr : They did ask for some concessions.

Daenerys Targaryen : Concessions?

Hizdahr : Politics is the art of compromise, your grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.

Hizdahr : Forgive me. You're right, of course. Still, it's easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones.

Daenerys Targaryen : I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery.

Hizdahr : They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.

Daenerys Targaryen : The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?

Hizdahr : In the new world that you've brought to us, free men would fight free men.

Hizdahr : The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.

Daenerys Targaryen : No fighting pits.

Hizdahr : Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.

Daenerys Targaryen : I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.

Hizdahr : If you--

Daenerys Targaryen : How many times must I say no before you understand?

Daenerys Targaryen : Whatever he wants from me he's not going to get it. If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits.

Daario : You should reopen the fighting pits.

Daenerys Targaryen : What?

Daario : My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before.

Daenerys Targaryen : Why?

Daario : I was a bad child. I wasn't big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16.

Daenerys Targaryen : You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits?

Daario : I'm only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you.

Daario : You're the queen. Everyone's too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You've made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they'll attack. Show your strength here, now.

Daenerys Targaryen : That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.

Daario : Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You're not the Mother of Unsullied. You're the Mother of Dragons.

Daenerys Targaryen : I don't want another childo s bones dropped at my feet. No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he's flown halfway across the world. I can't control them anymore.

Daario : A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.

Daenerys Targaryen : Viserion? Rhaegal?

Daenerys Targaryen : Easy. Easy. Easy.

Mance : So here we are.

Jon Snow : Here we are.

Mance : When we first met you were my prisoner. And now, for our last meeting.

Jon Snow : This doesn't have to be our last meeting.

Mance : No, but it will be.

Jon Snow : You know what Stannis wants?

Mance : He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I'll give him this much

Jon Snow : Shouldn't a king be bold?

Mance : Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he'll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I'll never serve him.

Jon Snow : You told me you weren't here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.

Mance : That's right. But I don't want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.

Jon Snow : You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?

Mance : Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn't about that.

Jon Snow : Then bend the knee and save your people.

Mance : They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king that's all gone.

Jon Snow : And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid.

Mance : Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?

Jon Snow : They'll burn you alive.

Mance : Bad way to go. I'll be honest with you, I don't want to die. And burnt to death, I don't want people to remember me like that. Scorched and screaming. But it's better than betraying everything I believe.

Jon Snow : And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. "You'd rather burn than kneel. The great hero."� Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there's no one left to sing.

Mance : You're a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you can't understand why I won't enlist my people in a foreigner's war, there's no point explaining.

Jon Snow : I think you're making a terrible mistake.

Mance : The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.

Stannis Baratheon : Mance Rayder, you've been called the King Beyond the Wall. Westeros only has one king. Bend the knee, I promise you mercy.

Stannis Baratheon : Kneel and live.

Mance : This was my home for many years. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.

Melisandre : Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. We choose light, or we choose darkness. We choose good, or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false.

Melisandre : Free folk, there is only one true king, and his name is Stannis. Here stands the king of lies. Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness.

Braavosi Man : In the old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger, the titan would step with fire in his eyes. He'd wade into the sea and smash the enemies.

Arya Stark : He's just a statue.

Man : Don't be afraid. He's announcing our arrival.

Arya Stark : I'm not afraid.

Man : The House of Black and White

Man : Here, I leave you.

Arya Stark : Thank you for bringing me.

Man : Any man of Braavos would have done the same. Valar morghulis.

Arya Stark : Valar dohaeris.

Arya Stark : Hello. Valar Morghulis.

Arya Stark : Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.

Old Man : No one here by that name.

Arya Stark : Please. I crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.

Old Man : You have everywhere else to go.

Arya Stark : But wait!

Arya Stark : Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant. Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant.

Arya Stark : The Mountain, Meryn Trant.

Podrick : Must be good food if it's crowded.

Waitress : Ale? Ale?

Sansa Stark : Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll.

Petyr Baelish : You are becoming an observant young lady.

Sansa Stark : My mother used to say, "dark wings, dark words".

Petyr Baelish : An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.

Sansa Stark : So it was good news.?

Petyr Baelish : My marriage proposal has been accepted.

Sansa Stark : I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.

Waitress : Ale?

Sansa Stark : I'll have some.

Podrick : My lady!

Brienne : What is it?

Podrick : Sansa Stark. Don't look!

Brienne : You sure?

Podrick : She's dyed her hair, but it's her. She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.

Brienne : Littlefinger?

Podrick : A bunch of knights with him.

Brienne : Bunch? What's a bunch? 100? 6? 20?

Podrick : 10, I think. Too many. My lady, I don't think this is the right--

Brienne : Ready the horses.

Podrick : We only have one horse.

Brienne : Find more.

Petyr Baelish : Do you like the taste?

Sansa Stark : I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?

Petyr Baelish : It gives some men courage.

Sansa Stark : Does it give you courage?

Guard : That's far enough.

Brienne : Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth.

Petyr Baelish : We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, "You're a loyalty comes free of charge." Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then.

Brienne : Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new.

Petyr Baelish : Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?

Brienne : I was.

Petyr Baelish : Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.

Brienne : It was after Renly's murder.

Petyr Baelish : Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him.

Brienne : I tried to save him.

Petyr Baelish : But you were accused.

Brienne : By men who didn't see what happened.

Petyr Baelish : Then what did happen?

Brienne : He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.

Petyr Baelish : A shadow? With a face? This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?

Brienne : Why should you have any say in her affairs?

Petyr Baelish : Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my belovedo s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders.

Brienne : Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--

Sansa Stark : No.

Brienne : Please, my lady. If I could explain--

Sansa Stark : I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.

Brienne : Neither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.

Sansa Stark : And sometimes we do. You should leave.

Petyr Baelish : We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?

Knight : He asked you to stay.

Guard : After her!

Brienne : Podrick!

Podrick : Stop, stop, stop! That's a good boy.

Knight : I guess that means you're unarmed.

Brienne : Down, Podrick, down!

Brienne : Podrick?

Podrick : Yes, my lady?

Brienne : You can stand now.

Podrick : Yes, my lady. Sansa Stark?

Brienne : Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We'll follow them.

Podrick : My lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you're released from your vow.

Brienne : I swore to their mother I'd protect those girls.

Podrick : If they don't want your protection--

Brienne : Do you think she's safe from Littlefinger?

Podrick : No, my lady.

Brienne : Get your horse.

Jaime Lannister : A summons from the queen.

Cersei Lannister : There are only two like it in the world

Jaime Lannister : It's a threat.

Cersei Lannister : Of course it's a threat! Our daughter's in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. "It's a threat."

Jaime Lannister : No note.

Cersei Lannister : They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that's befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her!

Jaime Lannister : Softer.

Cersei Lannister : What?

Jaime Lannister : Not so loud.

Cersei Lannister : Our daughter's in danger, and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly!

Jaime Lannister : The world can't know knows she's our daughter.

Cersei Lannister : Then don't call her your daughter. You've never been a father to her.

Jaime Lannister : If I was the father to any of my children, they'd be stoned in the streets.

Cersei Lannister : And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.

Jaime Lannister : I'll make things better.

Cersei Lannister : You never made anything better.

Jaime Lannister : I'm going to Dorne. I'll bring our daughter home.

Cersei Lannister : You can't just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She's promised his son.

Jaime Lannister : I'm not going to ask him anything.

Cersei Lannister : You go there with an army, it's an act of war.

Jaime Lannister : No army. Do you know where they're keeping her?

Cersei Lannister : Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.

Jaime Lannister : I'll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?

Cersei Lannister : You're going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?

Jaime Lannister : I never said I was going alone.

Lollys Stokeworth : No sunflowers. I don't like yellow. Roses are very nice, definitely roses. And music. I adore music. But no flutes, I hate flutes! We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes. Then there's the food. Food is the most important thing, don't you agree? We're going to need pigeon pies. That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?

Lollys : Don't they?

Bronn : Don't who?

Lollys : People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

Bronn : They certainly do, my dear. They certainly do.

Bronn : It's a fine place, isn't it? A fine place. I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this.

Lollys : You won't.

Bronn : Pardon?

Lollys : We won't get to live at Stokeworth. When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older.

Bronn : Oh.

Lollys : She hates me. She calls me mean names, and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when Mother isn't looking.

Bronn : You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.

Lollys : She is.

Bronn : I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another.

Lollys : Who's that?

Bronn : Jaime fucking Lannister.

Bronn : Ser Jaime.

Jaime Lannister : Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

Bronn : I was very sorry to hear about your father.

Jaime Lannister : Thank you.

Bronn : This is my betrothed, Lollys.

Jaime Lannister : A pleasure.

Bronn : Run along, love.

Jaime Lannister : Beautiful bride you've chosen. When were you planning on getting married?

Bronn : Just get on with it.

Jaime Lannister : On with what?

Bronn : What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.

Jaime Lannister : It's very good for you.

Bronn : Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken.

Jaime Lannister : Mmm.

Bronn : We made a deal, your sister and I.

Jaime Lannister : I would have advised against that.

Bronn : How is this good for me?

Jaime Lannister : Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle.

Bronn : Return from where?

Jaime Lannister : As far south as south goes.

Trystane : My future queen.

Areo : The prince does not wish to be disturbed.

Ellaria : Remove myself from my path, or I'll take that long axe and shove it--

Doran : Captain. Let her pass.

Ellaria : Your brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing.

Doran : Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat. By law, that is not murder.

Ellaria : Your brother--

Doran : You don't have to remind me. He was my brother long before he was anything to you.

Ellaria : What will you do about his death.

Doran : I will bury him. I will mourn for him.

Ellaria : You would have me go to war?

Doran : You would have me go to war?

Ellaria : The whole country would have you go to war.

Doran : Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.

Ellaria : The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.

Ellaria : Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?

Doran : I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.

Ellaria : And how long will that be?

Daario : The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

Daario : Anyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you?

Daario : My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it...

Grey Worm : No one here. We go.

Daario : In a hurry? You're afraid?

Grey Worm : Unsullied fear nothing.

Daario : Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide.

Daario : Fear is useful that way.

Mossador : Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck. On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace, you must kill him.

Daenerys Targaryen : It would send a message.

Barristan : I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : Why?

Barristan : For one thing, he may have valuable information.

Daario : The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.

Barristan : How do you know that?

Daario : Because I questioned him.

Hizdahr : And the information you did get, he is young and poor.

Mossador : He is born free.

Hizdahr : Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?

Daenerys Targaryen : Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.

Mossador : They pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.

Hizdahr : And how do you know this?

Mossador : Everyone knows this.

Hizdahr : I don't know it, and I'm the head of a great family.

Barristan : We do not know what this man did or didn't do. Give him a trial, at least. A fair trial. Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose. Teach them a better way.

Mossador : I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial

Daenerys Targaryen : Thank you all for your counsel.

Barristan : Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you.

Daenerys Targaryen : About what?

Barristan : About your father. About the Mad King.

Daenerys Targaryen : The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.

Barristan : Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first. Your enemies did not lie.

Daenerys Targaryen : Go on.

Barristan : When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two.

Daenerys Targaryen : I'm not my father.

Barristan : No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end.

Daenerys Targaryen : I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.

Barristan : Your Grace.

Tyrion Lannister : There's a bug.

Varys : Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food.

Tyrion Lannister : When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?

Varys : You don't like it?

Tyrion Lannister : I want to take a walk.

Varys : You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.

Tyrion Lannister : She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere.

Varys : Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?

Tyrion Lannister : You're right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?

Varys : The road to Meereen.

Tyrion Lannister : And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?

Varys : I told you. A ruler.

Tyrion Lannister : We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.

Varys : You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand.

Tyrion Lannister : I didn't rule. I was a servant.

Varys : Still, a man of talent.

Tyrion Lannister : Managed to kill a lot of people.

Varys : Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well.

Tyrion Lannister : She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.

Varys : Why?

Tyrion Lannister : Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.

Varys : People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.

Tyrion Lannister : I find us repulsive.

Varys : And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long.

Tyrion Lannister : You're right. Let's go for a walk.

Varys : No.

Tyrion Lannister : How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?

Cersei Lannister : Not him.

Meryn : Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?

Cersei Lannister : That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made.

Hunters : Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you.

Cersei Lannister : Take the head.

Qyburn : Pardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work.

Cersei Lannister : Very good.

Qyburn : Over there will be fine.

Meryn : You heard the man. Over there.

Kevan : You're the Hand of the King?

Cersei Lannister : No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself.

Mace Tyrell : Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--

Cersei Lannister : You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin.

Mace : Oh, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.

Mace : The honor is all mine, Your Grace.

Pycelle : Your Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand.

Cersei Lannister : The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.

Pycelle : Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?

Cersei Lannister : The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have.

Pycelle : I must say I cannot see--

Cersei Lannister : Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title.

Kevan : That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.

Cersei Lannister : The king is very busy at this moment.

Kevan : He should be here, learning what it means to rule.

Cersei Lannister : He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf.

Kevan : I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--

Cersei Lannister : My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.

Kevan : What mission?

Cersei Lannister : That is not your concern as Master of War.

Kevan : I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.

Cersei Lannister : You would abandon your king in his time of need?

Kevan : If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock.

Shireen : Come on. You know this one. It looks like an animal.

Gilly : Snake. Snake... S! It's an S!

Shireen : Right, very good!

Sam : Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?

Gilly : I know "S".

Shireen : You'll learn, I promise. I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things.

Gilly : Well, you're a wonderful teacher. Very patient!

Sam : I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read.

Gilly : That's alright. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.

Gilly : How old were you when you learned to read?

Shireen : Three.

Sam : Three?! Who taught you, your mother?

Shireen : No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because...

Gilly : What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?

Shireen : Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?

Gilly : I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?

Shireen : I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?

Gilly : My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.

Sam : Did you ever see them?

Gilly : Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope.

Shireen : What did he do to them in the woods?

Shireen : Mother.

Selyse : Leave us.

Sam : Your Grace.

Selyse : You need to stay away from that girl.

Shireen : Why?

Selyse : She's a wildling.

Shireen : Her name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.

Selyse : She's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.

Shireen : Gilly wouldn't do that.

Selyse : You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know.

Stannis Baratheon : I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you.

Jon Snow : With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive.

Stannis Baratheon : Who then? You?

Jon Snow : No. Only one of their own.

Stannis Baratheon : Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?

Jon Snow : The Lord Commander's niece.

Stannis Baratheon : Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response.

Jon Snow : Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark.

Stannis Baratheon : That amuses you?

Jon Snow : I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own.

Stannis Baratheon : I know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.

Davos : Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.

Jon Snow : Most likely.

Davos : Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?

Jon Snow : Unpleasant, I expect.

Stannis Baratheon : Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.

Jon Snow : I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you.

Stannis Baratheon : You can give me the North.

Jon Snow : I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow.

Stannis Baratheon : Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell.

Sam : He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?

Jon Snow : It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again.

Sam : You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.

Jon Snow : I'm going to refuse him.

Sam : But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.

Jon Snow : I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?

Alliser : Crowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew.

Aemon : Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?

Janos : Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility. He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings.

Men : Hear, hear.

Janos : He's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life. He's the only true choice.

Aemon : Is there anyone else?

Shadow Tower Brother : Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger. Through 10 winters he served. As commander of the Shadow Tower, he kept the wildlings away. We could do no better.

Aemon : If there's no one else, we will begin the voting. The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne. The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister. Each brother will--

Sam : Maester Aemon.

Aemon : Samwell Tarly. Go on.

Janos : Sam the Slayer.

Janos : Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow. How's your lady love Slayer?

Sam : Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.

Janos : Lies!

Sam : A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making.

Sam : Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading.

Sam : Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest.

Alliser : I can't argue with any of that. But who does Jon Snow want to command? Night's Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them?

Aemon : It is time.

Brother : It appears to be a tie, Maester.

Brothers : Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

Man : You. You!

Man : What have you got there?

Man : I said--

Arya Stark : Turn around and go. Turn around and go.

Man : That's a nice little sword. Worth 100 pieces, a sword like that.

Arya Stark : Nothing's worth anything to dead men.

Men : Quickly, go, go!

Arya Stark : Who are you? Why were they scared of you?

Old Man : You lost this.

Arya Stark : You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.

Jaqen Hghar : There isn't. A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.

Arya Stark : Well who are you then?

Jaqen Hghar : No one. And that is who a girl must become.

Harpy : She doesn't belong here. And no matter how many of your traitors call her "Mhysa", she will never be your mother.

Mossador : For you, Mhysa. You wanted the Harpy dead, but your hands were tied. I set you free, as you did all of us.

Daenerys Targaryen : He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right.

Mossador : He would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt.

Daenerys Targaryen : There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.

Mossador : Then who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children? When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you. I remember the look on my father's face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog. My father died in the fighting. If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains, he never lived.

Daenerys Targaryen : The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--

Mosador : and now you are the law!

Daenerys Targaryen : The law is the law. Take him.

Crowd : Mhysa! Myhsa!

Hizdahr : She should have cut off the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.

Daario : Which is what I keep telling her to do to you.

Daenerys Targaryen : You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice. One cannot exist without the other.

Crowd : Brother! Brother!

Mossador : Mhysa, please! Forgive me!

Daenerys Targaryen : A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him. The punishment is death.

Crowd : Mercy! Mercy!

Mossador : Mhysa...

Crowd : Mhysa...

Barristan : I'll stand guard outside your door tonight, Your Grace.

Grey Worm : We all guard tonight.

Daenerys Targaryen : Leave me.

Daenerys Targaryen : Drogon...

End : EPISODE

Man : Valar morghulis.

Jaqen Hghar : Valar dohaeris.

Arya Stark : I've been sweeping this floor for days.

Jaqen Hghar : Good.

Arya Stark : I didn't come here to sweep floors.

Jaqen Hghar : No? Why come, then?

Arya Stark : You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.

Jaqen Hghar : A man teaches a girl. . Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless men, most of all. .

Arya Stark : I want to serve. .

Jaqen Hghar : A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well. A girl must become no-one.

Arya Stark : Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.

Jaqen Hghar : There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.

Arya Stark : Where are they taking him?

Bystanders : Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery! Queen Margaery!

Margaery Tyrell : I am his/hers, and she/he is mine. From this day, until the end of my days.

Tommen Lannister : Did I hurt you?

Margaery Tyrell : No. You were lovely.

Tommen Lannister : It all happened so fast.

Margaery Tyrell : Yes. .

Tommen Lannister : I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded

Margaery Tyrell : No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived.

Tommen Lannister : This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life.

Margaery Tyrell : Wouldn't that be glorious? . Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?

Tommen Lannister : Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?

Margaery Tyrell : No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name.

Tommen Lannister : King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?

Margaery Tyrell : So strange. Husband.

Tommen Lannister : Wife. . Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, , and it's all because my brother died.

Margaery Tyrell : I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty.

Tommen Lannister : I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.

Tommen Lannister : Do you like to sail?

Margaery Tyrell : I love to sail.

Tommen Lannister : I do, too.

Margaery Tyrell : I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.

Margaery Tyrell : Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?

Tommen Lannister : I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.

Margaery Tyrell : It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. .

Tommen Lannister : Well, but I'm a man now.

Margaery Tyrell : You are. And the king. . But you'll always be her baby-boy.

Tommen Lannister : I suppose.

Margaery Tyrell : I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. . Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight.

Cersei Lannister : You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters.

Tommen Lannister : Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?

Cersei Lannister : There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.

Tommen Lannister : That's where you grew up. . You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.

Cersei Lannister : Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?

Tommen Lannister : The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home.

Cersei Lannister : This is my real home now. Where my family lives.

Tommen Lannister : I want you to be happy, mother.

Cersei Lannister : I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy.

Tommen Lannister : But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?

Margaery Tyrell : I said, "Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?" . And he said, "Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."

Margaery Tyrell : Mother! . Welcome.

Cersei Lannister : Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.

Margaery Tyrell : Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.

Cersei Lannister : No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you.

Margaery Tyrell : You are very sweet.

Cersei Lannister : Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.

Margaery Tyrell : I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.

Cersei Lannister : Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.

Margaery Tyrell : Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag. .

Cersei Lannister : I'll leave you to it then. .

Margaery Tyrell : Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?

Cersei Lannister : There's no need for such formalities.

Margaery Tyrell : In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon.

Cersei Lannister : Won't that be a lovely day.

Margaery Tyrell : Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.

Cersei Lannister : Remember. Anything you need.

Roose : We can't hold the North with terror alone.

Ramsay Bolton : You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.

Roose : I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies.

Ramsay Bolton : Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot.

Roose : He left you no choice.

Ramsay Bolton : I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch.

Roose : And?

Ramsay Bolton : The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.

Roose : I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.

Roose : We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?

Ramsay Bolton : Our pact with the Lannisters protects -

Roose : I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. . Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North.

Sansa Stark : That's Moat Cailin.

Petyr Baelish : Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before.

Sansa Stark : On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and. where are you taking me?

Petyr Baelish : Home.

Sansa Stark : The Boltons have Winterfell. . The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?

Petyr Baelish : No.

Sansa Stark : Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!

Petyr Baelish : He did.

Sansa Stark : He serves the Lannisters.

Petyr Baelish : For now.

Sansa Stark : I won't go.

Petyr Baelish : Winterfell is your home.

Sansa Stark : Not anymore.

Petyr Baelish : Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.

Sansa Stark : I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.

Petyr Baelish : You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -

Sansa Stark : No!

Petyr Baelish : Sansa -

Sansa Stark : No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there.

Petyr Baelish : I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. . You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them.

Podrick : How do we get through there?

Brienne : We don't. We go around. .

Podrick : It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.

Brienne : Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.

Brienne : Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?

Podrick : He hates that nickname.

Brienne : Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?

Podrick : I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham.

Brienne : He borrowed it?

Podrick : He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son.

Brienne : As punishment. For both of you.

Podrick : It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.

Brienne : Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person.

Podrick : I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.

Brienne : I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.

Podrick : If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.

Brienne : You want to be a knight, Pod?

Podrick : Yes.

Brienne : Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. . And I'm going to show you how to ride properly.

Podrick : Thank you.

Brienne : I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight.

Podrick : I suppose that's more important.

Podrick : You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?

Brienne : I was.

Podrick : Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.

Brienne : He was.

Podrick : But how did you end up serving Renly?

Brienne : When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. . And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. . My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. . Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. 'Brienne the Beauty', they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. "Don't let them see your tears,"� he told me. "They're nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over."� He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all.

Podrick : But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...

Brienne : Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly.

Podrick : But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?

Brienne : A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed.

Stannis Baratheon : Lord Commander.

Jon Snow : Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : I'd like to speak alone.

Jon Snow : Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command.

Stannis Baratheon : Very well. . Have you considered my offer?

Jon Snow : I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.

Stannis Baratheon : Say the word and you will be.

Jon Snow : But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.

Stannis Baratheon : I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.

Jon Snow : I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.

Stannis Baratheon : You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.

Jon Snow : I can imagine no higher praise.

Stannis Baratheon : I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. . But if your mindo s made up, I won't try to persuade you.

Jon Snow : May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?

Stannis Baratheon : Are you bored of us already?

Jon Snow : You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.

Stannis Baratheon : I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.

Jon Snow : And the wildlings?

Stannis Baratheon : They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. . Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead.

Jon Snow : Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. .

Stannis Baratheon : You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.

Stannis Baratheon : You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

Jon Snow : I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.

Stannis Baratheon : Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.

Davos : He sees something in you. . Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you.

Jon Snow : I'm sorry I disappointed him.

Davos : The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.

Jon Snow : As long as he's ruling them.

Davos : He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.

Jon Snow : I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.

Davos : Have you now? . How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.

Olly : Night gathers and now my watch begins -

Davos : Not that bit, the bit at the end.

Olly : I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -

Davos : Wait, that's enough. "The shield that guards the realm of men."� That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing.

Jon Snow : And what needs to be done?

Davos : As long as the Boltons rule the North, , the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion.

Arya Stark : What do you want?

Waif : Who are you?

Arya Stark : What?

Waif : You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect. . Who are you?

Arya Stark : No one.

Arya Stark : Ow! Cunt!

Waif : A lie, a sad little lie. Who are you?

Arya Stark : I told you, I'm no - . Do that again and -

Arya Stark : You're about to find out.

Jaqen Hghar : What are you doing?

Waif : We were only playing. The game of faces.

Jaqen Hghar : A girl is not ready.

Waif : Clearly not.

Arya Stark : I am ready.

Jaqen Hghar : For what? For whatever you want. To be a Faceless Man. To be no one.

Jaqen Hghar : Whose sword is that? It belongs to Arya Stark. Arya Stark's sword, Arya Stark's clothes, Arya Stark's stolen silver. A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?

Arya Stark : What do we do with them after we wash them?

Man : Open gates!

Roose : Lady Sansa, welcome.

Sansa Stark : Lord Bolton.

Roose : May I introduce my son, , Ramsay Bolton?

Ramsay Bolton : It's an honor to meet you, my Lady.

Woman : I'll bring you a bowl of hot water. You must want to wash.

Sansa Stark : Thank you.

Woman : Welcome home, Lady Stark. The North remembers.

Jon Snow : Sam. . Maester Aemon?

Sam : He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.

Jon Snow : Take good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger.

Jon Snow : Ser Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger.

Jon Snow : Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.

Janos : Greyguard is a ruin.

Jon Snow : Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -

Janos : I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. Keep your ruin.

Sam : Alright, alright! Enough of that.

Jon Snow : You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard.

Janos : I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!

Jon Snow : Are you refusing to obey my order?

Janos : You can stick your order up your bastard arse.

Jon Snow : Take Lord Janos outside.

Jon Snow : Olly, bring me my sword.

Janos : You cannot do this! Get your hands off me! . Scum, all of you! If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken, yes, very mistaken.

Janos : A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! You'll see!

Jon Snow : If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time.

Janos : I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander! We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong! . My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid.

Olyvar : You have served us well, my son.

Septon : Thank you, Father.

Olyvar : Which of the Seven will you worship today?

Septon : The Maiden.

Olyvar : Where is the Maiden?

Septon : And the Stranger.

Olyvar : Two is extra, you realize?

Septon : Yes, yes.

Olyvar : What are you doing? This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish. You can't -

Lancel : You have profaned our faith. The faith of our fathers and forefathers.

Septon : I am the High Septon of the -

Lancel : You are a sinner. And you shall be punished.

Crowd : Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!

Man : Repent!

Crowd : Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!

Man : Shame on you!

Crowd : Sinner! Sinner!

Septon : Your Grace, , Grandmaester, Lord Tyrell, , uh.

Qyburn : It doesn't matter. .

Septon : As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion.

Cersei Lannister : You were assaulted?

Septon : I was, by those fanatics who call themselves 'sparrows'. They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive.

Qyburn : I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.

Mace : High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear.

Septon : I tend to both the highest born, and the lowliest amongst us. Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother.

Qyburn : So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?

Pycelle : A man's private affairs ought to stay private!

Cersei Lannister : What do you want from us, High Septon?

Septon : Justice! I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells. I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow. He's a threat to everything we hold sacred. If he goes unpunished -

Cersei Lannister : And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?

Meryn : I don't think this is a good idea, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. . Where can I find the High Sparrow?

Man : Seven blessings.

Man : Thank you.

Man : Just a little more...

Woman : Thank you ever so for the soup!

Cersei Lannister : A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?

Sparrow : High Sparrow? Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Like Lord Duckling, or King Turtle. . So, it's meant to. We're often stuck with the names our enemies give to us. . The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me.

Woman : Seven blessings to you.

Sparrow : Seven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. .

Cersei Lannister : Why no shoes?

Sparrow : Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.

Cersei Lannister : Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?

Sparrow : Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so.

Cersei Lannister : Perhaps they're right.

Sparrow : It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon.

Cersei Lannister : An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?

Sparrow : Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade.

Cersei Lannister : The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you.

Sparrow : I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.

Cersei Lannister : My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. . The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another.

Qyburn : Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. .

Qyburn : At once, Your Grace. .

Cersei Lannister : How's your work coming along?

Qyburn : Very well.

Cersei Lannister : You've made progress?

Qyburn : More than I've expected. Still a way to go, but.

Cersei Lannister : Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word "immediately".

Qyburn : Shh. Easy, friend.

Ramsay Bolton : She really is lovely. I hope I can make her happy.

Petyr Baelish : I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She's suffered enough.

Ramsay Bolton : I'll never hurt her. You have my word.

Petyr Baelish : I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go.

Ramsay Bolton : I haven't been a lord very long. I was a bastard.

Roose : And you're not anymore. Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.

Ramsay Bolton : Yes, father. And thank you, Lord Baelish. I'm forever in your debt. .

Petyr Baelish : He seems pleased.

Roose : Shouldn't he be?

Petyr Baelish : I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must.

Roose : I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not her virtue.

Petyr Baelish : Then I have delivered everything I've promised.

Roose : And you prepared for the consequences. When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.

Petyr Baelish : The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.

Roose : The Queen will be enraged.

Petyr Baelish : Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day.

Roose : And yet she still has friends. Men in important places, whom she can ask for favours. . A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale.

Petyr Baelish : A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken.

Roose : I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?

Petyr Baelish : Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.

Roose : I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?

Petyr Baelish : The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply.

Roose : I'd like to read the reply.

Tyrion Lannister : I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

Varys : Volantis is a large city.

Varys : The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.

Tyrion Lannister : Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.

Varys : I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.

Tyrion Lannister : I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.

Varys : It's a perfectly good face.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm losing my mind.

Varys : If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that.

Tyrion Lannister : Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. . What am I? . One more drunk dwarf.

Tyrion Lannister : Slaves.

Varys : Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. . Flies for dung shovelers. . Hammers for builders. . Tears for whores. Lest they forget.

Priestess : Lord cast your light upon us.

Crowd : Lord cast your light upon us.

Priestess : For the night is dark and full of terrors.

Varys : We should keep moving.

Crowd : For the night is dark and full of terrors.

Priestess : I was once as you are now.

Priestess : Bought and sold, , scourged and branded...

Tyrion Lannister : The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.

Priestess : The Lord of Light hears your voice. He hears the king as he hears the slave; he hears the Stone Men in their misery...

Tyrion Lannister : Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. .

Priestess : He has sent you a saviour! From the fire she was reborn to remake the world! The Dragon Queen!

Tyrion Lannister : We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?

Tyrion Lannister : Come on. Let's find a brothel.

Man : It's good luck to rub a dwarf's head.

Tyrion Lannister : It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.

Tyrion Lannister : See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust.

Varys : Thank you.

Tyrion Lannister : Curious... hair. .

Man : The mother of dragons!

Tyrion Lannister : It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.

Varys : Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.

Man : What makes you worth that much?

Blonde Prostitute : I'm magic. .

Man : I bet you bloody are.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, , she's taken.

Varys : Where're you going?

Tyrion Lannister : I need to speak to someone with hair.

Tyrion Lannister : Hello?

Black Haired Prostitute : Hello.

Tyrion Lannister : You've got no drink.

Black Haired Prostitute : You've got no money.

Tyrion Lannister : Do I look like a man without money? . Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. . But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? . I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it.

Black Haired Prostitute : You like her? They all like her. They all want to fuck a queen.

Tyrion Lannister : That's because they've never met a queen.

Black Haired Prostitute : You're just saying that.

Tyrion Lannister : You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you.

Black Haired Prostitute : Why?

Tyrion Lannister : Because you have a skeptical mind.

Black Haired Prostitute : Alright, then. I'm warning you. We're gonna have to wash you first.

Black Haired Prostitute : Come on.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm, I'm sorry, I can't.

Black Haired Prostitute : Of course you can. You're shy.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not.

Black Haired Prostitute : Have another drink.

Tyrion Lannister : Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I'll go for a piss, that's a start.

Tyrion Lannister : No need to worry, I was just - . Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige.

Tyrion Lannister : You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and -

Jorah Mormont : I'm taking you to the Queen.

End : EPISODE

Jaime Lannister : Is that Estermont?

Captain : Tarth, Ser Jaime. . The Sapphire Isle.

Bronn : Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?

Jaime Lannister : This ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night.

Bronn : You ever been to Dorne?

Jaime Lannister : No.

Bronn : I have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck. Fuck and fight.

Jaime Lannister : You should be happy to go back. .

Bronn : There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. . And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess.

Jaime Lannister : We are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,

Bronn : Your niece?

Bronn : I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. .

Jaime Lannister : That's why you're here.

Bronn : I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one.

Jaime Lannister : Because I don't want to start a war.

Bronn : That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.

Jaime Lannister : It has to be me.

Bronn : If I'm putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, , who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros, is not -

Bronn : You set your brother free, didn't you? I bet your sister didn't like that.

Jaime Lannister : Varys set him free.

Bronn : Well, if you ever see the little fucker, , give him my regards.

Jaime Lannister : He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards.

Mace : The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crown's debts. Given the expense of rebuilding the royal -

Cersei Lannister : How much can the Crown afford?

Mace : With winter coming, half what they ask. Less.

Cersei Lannister : You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?

Mace : Well, House Tyrell could front the gold, and the the Crown will pay us back in time, or I'll have words with my daughter.

Cersei Lannister : You've already given us too much. . No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank.

Mace : Absolutely.

Cersei Lannister : In person.

Mace : Me? .

Cersei Lannister : We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified.

Mace : I will be honored, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. . He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.

Mace : My very own Kingsguard? Please express -

Cersei Lannister : Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.

Mace : Of course, of course, . I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos.

Pycelle : The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.

Cersei Lannister : Not small enough.

Cersei Lannister : May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?

Sparrow : No. .

Cersei Lannister : The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. .

Sparrow : I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure. But the truth is, , I don't like the taste.

Cersei Lannister : Hmm.

Sparrow : How may I serve?

Cersei Lannister : All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.

Sparrow : Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods.

Cersei Lannister : Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. . In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven.

Sparrow : Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago.

Cersei Lannister : If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy.

Sparrow : An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people.

Cersei Lannister : An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven.

Sparrow : An honor I never expected. Or indeed, ever wished for.

Cersei Lannister : Which is why you were chosen. . You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most.

Sparrow : All sinners are equal before the Gods.

Cersei Lannister : What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.

Sparrow : May the Father judge him justly. .

Merchant : Help me! Help me!

Olyvar : This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.

Militant : Cocksucker! . Boy fucker! You barbaric filth! There's a special place in the Seventh Hell for your kind.

Client : Please, please, I'll pay! I'll pay all of you.

Militant : Yes, you will! Seize him.

Militant : Seize him.

Loras : Get your hands off of me.

Lancel : Ser Loras of House Tyrell, you have broken the laws of Gods and men.

Loras : Who do you think you are?

Lancel : Justice. .

Margaery Tyrell : Why is my brother in a cell?

Tommen Lannister : I, I don't know. I, I didn't order it.

Margaery Tyrell : We both know who did. . You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.

Tommen Lannister : Are you saying my mother is behind this?

Margaery Tyrell : She's jealous you're not hers anymore. Arresting my brother is her revenge.

Tommen Lannister : Aren't you and mother getting along?

Margaery Tyrell : Oh, my sweet, sweet King. . Do you have any affection for me at all?

Tommen Lannister : Of course I do. You're my Queen.

Margaery Tyrell : I can't bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell.

Tommen Lannister : I'll set him free for you.

Margaery Tyrell : Do you promise?

Tommen Lannister : I demand that Ser Loras be freed now!

Cersei Lannister : Did I arrest him?

Tommen Lannister : Well, no... But you armed the Faith Militant. You gave the High Sparrow an army.

Cersei Lannister : I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. . Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions.

Tommen Lannister : Then can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?

Cersei Lannister : I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy.

Kingsguard : Halt!

Militant : His Holiness is praying. He will not be disturbed.

Kingsguard : Give the order and we'll tear out this rebel.

Tommen Lannister : You mean, kill them? Here, in the sept?

Kingsguard : You'll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love.

Man : Bastard!

Man : You're an abomination!

Man : You're born of sin!

Woman : Filthy bastard!

Tommen Lannister : We'll find another way.

Man : Abomination!

Tommen Lannister : My Queen?

Tommen Lannister : There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence.

Margaery Tyrell : You're the King of the Andals, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm. And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law.

Tommen Lannister : I'm going to speak to the High Sparrow.

Margaery Tyrell : Are you? When?

Tommen Lannister : I--I don't know.

Margaery Tyrell : You don't know?

Tommen Lannister : He was praying just now.

Margaery Tyrell : I have to send word to Grandmother.

Tommen Lannister : Will you come back later? .

Margaery Tyrell : I need to be with my family, Your Grace. .

Tommen Lannister : Of course.

Selyse : You think highly of this boy.

Jon Snow : Good.

Stannis Baratheon : Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

Selyse : A bastard by some tavern slut.

Stannis Baratheon : Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.

Selyse : I should have given you a son.

Stannis Baratheon : Not your fault.

Selyse : Whose then? . I gave you nothing but weakness. . And deformity. .

Melisandre : Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.

Selyse : My Lady.

Melisandre : Her father is the Lordo s chosen King. And her father's blood runs through her veins.

Melisandre : You march on Winterfell soon?

Stannis Baratheon : We must. To beat the snows.

Melisandre : Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind. I hope you won't make that mistake again.

Stannis Baratheon : I won't. I need you.

Melisandre : You only need faith, my King.

Stannis Baratheon : And you, my Lady, what do you need?

Melisandre : To serve my Lord.

Sam : Lord Ashford. . Lady Caulfield. . Lord Smallwood.

Jon Snow : Never even heard of these people.

Sam : They haven't heard of you either. . But we need men and they have some.

Jon Snow : And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?

Sam : More than Lord Wibberley.

Jon Snow : Not him.

Sam : I know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North.

Jon Snow : He murdered my brother.

Sam : We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.

Sam : Apologies, my Lady.

Melisandre : Lord Commander.

Jon Snow : How can I help you?

Melisandre : Come with us when we ride south. . None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? .

Jon Snow : Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.

Melisandre : There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. .

Jon Snow : You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions.

Melisandre : No visions. No magic. Just life.

Melisandre : Do you feel my heart beating? This power in you, you resist it, and that's your mistake. Embrace it.

Melisandre : The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows.

Jon Snow : I don't think Stannis would like that very much.

Melisandre : Then we shouldn't tell him. .

Jon Snow : I can't.

Melisandre : Why?

Jon Snow : I swore a vow. . I loved another.

Melisandre : The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.

Jon Snow : I know. But I still love her.

Melisandre : You know nothing, Jon Snow.

Stannis Baratheon : Are you lonely?

Shireen : Just bored.

Stannis Baratheon : My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.

Shireen : Were you bored a lot, too?

Stannis Baratheon : I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -

Shireen : I like it. . I thought I'd be left at home. I know mother didn't want to bring me. .

Stannis Baratheon : Why do you say that?

Shireen : She told me, "I don't want to bring you."

Stannis Baratheon : She shouldn't have said that.

Shireen : Are you ashamed of me, father?

Stannis Baratheon : When you were an infant, , the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, , and you pressed it to your cheek. . By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. . I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. . Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. . I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. . You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter.

Petyr Baelish : I thought I might find you here. . Your Aunt Lyanna.

Sansa Stark : Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful.

Petyr Baelish : I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?

Sansa Stark : Yes, he chose her. and then he kidnapped her and raped her.

Petyr Baelish : Come. . Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. .

Sansa Stark : Dressed for riding?

Petyr Baelish : I am.

Sansa Stark : Where are you going?

Petyr Baelish : King's Landing.

Sansa Stark : King's Landing?

Petyr Baelish : Cersei sent for me. . We must not let her sniff out any trouble.

Sansa Stark : You can't leave me here!

Petyr Baelish : I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long.

Sansa Stark : How do you know?

Petyr Baelish : Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell.

Sansa Stark : You don't know that.

Petyr Baelish : I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.

Sansa Stark : You think he'll defeat the Boltons?

Petyr Baelish : He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. . As it happens, I am a betting man.

Sansa Stark : And if you're right?

Petyr Baelish : Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North.

Sansa Stark : But I, I wouldn't. Wardeness of the North

Petyr Baelish : You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.

Sansa Stark : What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?

Petyr Baelish : Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours.

Sansa Stark : I don't know how to do that.

Petyr Baelish : Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.

Sansa Stark : His father frightens me.

Petyr Baelish : He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you've learnt to maneuver from the very best. . I return before too long. . You'll be strong without me. . The North will be yours. Do you believe me?

Sansa Stark : I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.

Bronn : Breakfast.

Bronn : That would have been a shit way to die.

Jaime Lannister : As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die.

Bronn : Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.

Jaime Lannister : I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.

Bronn : No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me.

Jaime Lannister : Sounds like all the rest.

Jaime Lannister : What about you? What shit way would you choose?

Bronn : In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune.

Jaime Lannister : How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.

Bronn : I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?

Jaime Lannister : In the arms of the woman I love.

Bronn : She want the same thing?

Jaime Lannister : Let's go.

Bronn : The captain to that ship. What was he, Braavosi?

Jaime Lannister : Pentoshi.

Bronn : And he's headed to Oldtown?

Jaime Lannister : As I said. Why?

Bronn : What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?

Jaime Lannister : A bag of gold.

Bronn : I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.

Jaime Lannister : It was a heavy bag.

Bronn : And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.

Bronn : How many you count?

Jaime Lannister : Four.

Bronn : How many you think you can take?

Jaime Lannister : One, if he's slow.

Rider : Halt!

Bronn : Fucked in the arse. . Hiya! . Morning, lads. Glad we found you.

Rider : Who are you?

Bronn : Cooper. . This is Darnell.

Rider : You're from King's Landing.

Bronn : Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.

Rider : Why are you here?

Bronn : Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really.

Jaime Lannister : I thought the sharks would get us. .

Rider : There are no sharks in Dorne.

Jaime Lannister : I could have sworn those were shark fins.

Bronn : Dolphins maybe.

Rider : Throw your swords in the sand.

Bronn : Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home.

Rider : Swords in the sand! Now!

Bronn : That one should be slow enough.

Bronn : Nice move! .

Jaime Lannister : Luck.

Bronn : You had a wonderful teacher.

Bronn : Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.

Jaime Lannister : First we need to bury these bodies.

Bronn : Birds have to eat too.

Jaime Lannister : Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war.

Bronn : Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?

Jaime Lannister : I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really.

Tyene : Nama!

Elaria : Nym, Obara.

Obara : Will it be war?

Elaria : Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.

Obara : Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.

Elaria : We don't need an army to start a war. . Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them.

Nymeria : We may have a problem.

Obara : A ship's captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell. He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne.

Elaria : He's come for Myrcella. If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge. You must choose. Doran's way and peace, or my way and war.

Tyene : I'm with you. Always. .

Elaria : Nym? . Obara?

Obara : When I was a child, , Oberyn came to take me to court. I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl.

Obara : I made my choice long ago.

Tyrion Lannister : Thank you. . Who are you?

Jorah Mormont : Your captor.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you have wine?

Jorah Mormont : No.

Tyrion Lannister : I can't sleep without wine.

Jorah Mormont : Then stay awake.

Tyrion Lannister : You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.

Jorah Mormont : I'm not taking you to your sister.

Tyrion Lannister : You said you were taking me to the Queen.

Jorah Mormont : I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.

Tyrion Lannister : What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!

Jorah Mormont : What business would you have with the Queen?

Tyrion Lannister : Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? . A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. . And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely.

Daenerys Targaryen : Everyone looks happy enough from up here. . What?

Barristan : I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing.

Daenerys Targaryen : Why?

Barristan : He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them.

Daenerys Targaryen : He sang to them?

Barristan : Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.

Daenerys Targaryen : And what did you do?

Barristan : I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. . Well he liked to see how much he could make.

Daenerys Targaryen : He was good?

Barristan : He was very good. Viserys never told you?

Daenerys Targaryen : He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. .

Barristan : Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.

Daenerys Targaryen : And what did you do with the money?

Barristan : Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. .

Daario : Your Grace. Hizdahr is here, waiting in your audience chamber.

Daenerys Targaryen : How many others are there?

Daario : Fifty a hundred.

Daenerys Targaryen : Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?

Daario : I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq.

Daenerys Targaryen : I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me.

Barristan : Your Grace. .

Hizdahr : All men must die. But not all can die in glory.

Missandei : Glory?

Hizdahr : Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have.

Daenerys Targaryen : Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?

Hizdahr : Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season.

Daenerys Targaryen : I do not recognize this tradition.

Hizdahr : Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together. . Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common. Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems, but it's a start.

Woman : Sons of the Harpy.

End : EPISODE

Hizdahr : I am so sorry, my queen. He was a good man.

Daenerys Targaryen : Barristan the Bold" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks.

Daario : We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide.

Daenerys Targaryen : I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.

Hizdahr : But... I'm the leader of my family.

Hizdahr : No, Your Grace! I had nothing to do with this. Your Grace!

Daenerys Targaryen : Walk forward.

Man : You cannot do this.

Daenerys Targaryen : Another step.

Daenerys Targaryen : They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don't. Children. Some say I should give up on them. . But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must.

Daenerys Targaryen : But she does not give up on them.

Daenerys Targaryen : Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, , maybe none of you are. Maybe, , I should let the dragons decide.

Hizdahr : All men must die.

Daenerys Targaryen : Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.

Sam : And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure." She sounds like quite a woman.

Aemon : And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying.

Sam : Don't say that, Maester Aemon.

Aemon : A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing.

Jon Snow : Maester Aemon.

Aemon : Lord Commander.

Jon Snow : Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.

Jon Snow : How are you feeling?

Aemon : Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death.

Jon Snow : I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.

Aemon : Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it.

Jon Snow : But you don't know what it is.

Aemon : That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born.

Jon Snow : Where are the rest of the free folk now? . Where have they gone? . Who leads them?

Tormund : They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.

Jon Snow : What about you?

Tormund : Hard to lead when you're in chains.

Jon Snow : What if I unchained you?

Tormund : Why would you do that?

Jon Snow : Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.

Tormund : You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.

Jon Snow : For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you.

Tormund : And now everything is going to change?

Jon Snow : It is.

Tormund : Why now?

Jon Snow : Because now, , I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

Tormund : What would you have me do, , Lord Commander?

Jon Snow : I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.

Tormund : They won't kneel for you and neither will I.

Jon Snow : I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.

Tormund : The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.

Jon Snow : And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward.

Tormund : Easy thing to say to a man in chains.

Jon Snow : Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.

Tormund : Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?

Jon Snow : Up on Storroldo s Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.

Tormund : We'll need ships.

Jon Snow : I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.

Tormund : All right, then. You're coming with me. You're the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. They need to hear it from you. They need to know the ships they are boarding won't be torched in the middle of the sea. You come with me, or I don't go.

Man : You'd bring wildlings here, through our gates?

Jon Snow : Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing.

Man : Let them die. We got our own to worry about. Less enemies for us.

Stannis Baratheon : Fewer.

Davos : What?

Stannis Baratheon : Nothing.

Sam : There is good farmland in the Gift. . Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.

Man : And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.

Allister : We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.

Jon Snow : And we've slaughtered theirs.

Edd : I will follow you anywhere, you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. . They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it.

Jon Snow : You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that.

Jon Snow : Thank you. . Olly. . If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right.

Olly : You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them.

Jon Snow : It's not a trick.

Olly : They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew.

Jon Snow : I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.

Olly : Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?

Jon Snow : No.

Podrick : She's far away from the Lannisters. This is her home. Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.

Brienne : Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.

Brienne : Thank you. You've lived here a long time?

Man : Aye.

Brienne : Did you know Lord Eddard?

Man : I knew him and his father before him. The Starks are gone now.

Brienne : Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.

Man : Everyone knows. The Boltons.

Brienne : I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.

Man : Who are you?

Brienne : Someone who swore to keep her safe.

Man : Swore to who?

Brienne : Her mother.

Man : Her mother's dead.

Brienne : That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?

Ramsay Bolton : Come back here. Myranda.

Myranda : I saw you staring at her.

Ramsay Bolton : I'm going to marry her. That will involve looking at her from time to time.

Myranda : You said you'd marry me.

Ramsay Bolton : And I meant it. When I was a bastard named Snow. But I'm a Bolton now. What I want is no longer the primary consideration. I'm furthering a dynasty.

Myranda : Do you think she's pretty?

Ramsay Bolton : Of course I do. I'm not blind.

Ramsay Bolton : You think she's pretty, too. I'm looking forward to our wedding night. But don't worry, I'll have plenty of time for you.

Myranda : Perhaps I'll marry, too.

Ramsay Bolton : You're the kennel master's daughter. Who are you going to marry, the stable keeper's son? . You're mine. You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?

Myranda : Never.

Woman : Beg pardon, my lady. I've come to refill the wash basin.

Sansa Stark : Oh, I don't need-

Woman : You still have friends in the North. If you're ever in trouble, light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower.

Sansa Stark : But who -

Woman : You're not alone.

Myranda : I like your dress. Who made it for you?

Sansa Stark : I made it myself.

Myranda : Really?

Sansa Stark : Who, who are you?

Myranda : I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter. May I? . Oh, wonderful. The stitching. Who taught you?

Sansa Stark : My mother. .

Myranda : I'm sorry for what happened to her.

Sansa Stark : Thank you.

Myranda : It's good that she taught you. It was a gift. Now every time you wear something you made, you can remember her.

Sansa Stark : I'd rather have a mother.

Myranda : I know. It's not the same. Still, it's good to remember. Remember the way things were. I almost forgot. There's something else to help you remember.

Myranda : Down there at the end.

Sansa Stark : What is it?

Myranda : That would spoil the surprise. Go ahead, it's perfectly safe. You won't believe it when you see it.

Sansa Stark : Theon?

Theon Greyjoy : You shouldn't be here.

Ramsay Bolton : You smell particularly ripe this evening. Pour me some wine.

Ramsay Bolton : Do you have something to tell me?

Theon Greyjoy : No, my lord.

Ramsay Bolton : Reek.

Theon Greyjoy : She saw me.

Ramsay Bolton : Who?

Theon Greyjoy : Sansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels.

Ramsay Bolton : She saw you?

Theon Greyjoy : Yes. I'm sorry, master. Forgive me. I didn't think -

Ramsay Bolton : Come here.

Ramsay Bolton : You mustn't keep secrets from me, Reek. Get on your knees.

Ramsay Bolton : Give me your hand.

Ramsay Bolton : I forgive you.

Roose : I trust you find your chamber suitable, my lady.

Sansa Stark : Yes, thank you, my lord.

Ramsay Bolton : Allow me.

Ramsay Bolton : Mother.

Walda : Thank you, Ramsay.

Ramsay Bolton : My lady, we are all a family, we northerners. Our blood ties go back thousands of years. So I'd like to drink to our wedding. May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth.

Roose : To your wedding.

Walda : To your wedding.

Walda : It must be difficult for you being in a strange place.

Sansa Stark : This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.

Ramsay Bolton : You're right. Very strange. More wine, please.

Ramsay Bolton : I heard you two had reunited. A fitting place for it. . I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room. Are you still angry with him after he - what he did? Don't worry. The North remembers. I punished him for it. He's not ironborn anymore. Not Theon Greyjoy anymore. He's a new man. A new person, anyway. Aren't you, Reek?

Theon Greyjoy : Yes, master.

Ramsay Bolton : That's his new name, Reek.

Sansa Stark : Why are you doing this?

Ramsay Bolton : Because Reek has something to say to you. Don't you, Reek? . An apology. Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did. Apologize for murdering her two brothers.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm sorry.

Ramsay Bolton : Look at her, Reek. An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye.

Ramsay Bolton : Sorry about what?

Theon Greyjoy : For killing your brothers.

Ramsay Bolton : There, over and done with. Doesn't everyone feel better? I do. That was getting very tense. Whew. . You know what, my lady? What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left. Reek. You will give away the bride. Someone has to. What better person? Good? Good?

Roose : Yes, yes, very good.

Ramsay Bolton : Wonderful. .

Roose : Walda and I have some good news as well, since we're all together.

Walda : We're going to have a baby.

Sansa Stark : I'm very happy for you.

Roose : From the way she's carrying, Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy.

Ramsay Bolton : How can you be sure?

Roose : Sure of what?

Ramsay Bolton : That she's pregnant. I mean how can you tell?

Roose : Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt.

Ramsay Bolton : So how did you manage it?

Roose : Manage what?

Ramsay Bolton : Getting her pregnant.

Roose : I imagine you're familiar with the procedure.

Ramsay Bolton : Of course, but how did you find it?

Roose : You disgraced yourself at dinner, parading that creature before the Stark girl.

Ramsay Bolton : And if it's a boy?

Roose : You're worried about your position.

Ramsay Bolton : My position is quite clear. I'm your son until a better alternative comes along.

Roose : You've never asked me about your mother.

Ramsay Bolton : Why would I? She had me, she died. And here we are.

Roose : She was a peasant girl. Pretty in a common sort of way. She was the miller's wife. Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent. So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. . But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. . Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long. He wants the Iron Throne, and the road to King's Landing comes right through Winterfell. He means to take the North. But the North is ours. It's yours and mine. Will you help me defeat him?

Ramsay Bolton : Yes.

Gilly : Is this every book there is?

Sam : Every book there is?

Gilly : In the world.

Sam : Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually.

Gilly : Where you grew up, were there more books?

Sam : My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.

Gilly : Where's that?

Sam : The Citadel? In Oldtown.

Gilly : I'm sorry I don't know things.

Sam : Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound.

Gilly : I can wash the linens. I can sweep the floor.

Sam : Well -

Gilly : Why does the Citadel have the biggest library?

Sam : It's where they train the maesters.

Gilly : Like Maester Aemon?

Sam : I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you.

Sam : Ah, Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : You're Samwell Tarly?

Sam : I am, Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker.

Sam : I did, Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : How?

Sam : With a dagger made of dragonglass.

Stannis Baratheon : Dragonglass?

Sam : What the maesters call obsidian -

Stannis Baratheon : I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?

Sam : I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass.

Stannis Baratheon : The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.

Sam : I've seen it, Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : Seen what?

Sam : The army of the dead. And when they come -

Stannis Baratheon : We have to know how to fight them. . Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.

Stannis Baratheon : It's time.

Davos : Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men.

Stannis Baratheon : If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise.

Davos : I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.

Stannis Baratheon : No need, they're coming with us.

Davos : It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -

Stannis Baratheon : Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us.

Davos : As you wish, Your Grace.

Shireen : Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt?

Davos : Beg your pardon?

Shireen : At Winterfell. All the Kings in the North are buried there. Bran the Builder and King Dorren and-

Davos : First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.

Shireen : Is there going to be a battle?

Davos : Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -

Selyse : That's enough talk of battle, Ser Davos. You'll scare the child.

Davos : Yes, my queen.

Shireen : I'm not scared.

Davos : Well, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me.

Shireen : I promise.

Stannis Baratheon : I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.

Jon Snow : You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you.

Missandei : You're still too weak. .

Grey Worm : How long have I been here?

Missandei : Three days.

Grey Worm : Ser Barristan?

Grey Worm : I failed him. I failed my men, I failed my queen.

Missandei : You failed no one. You fought bravely. You'll fight again. Are you ashamed? You were ambushed, outnumbered. There was no way you could have known.

Grey Worm : This is not why. Wounded in war, there is no shame for this. I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground, I am afraid.

Missandei : All men fear death.

Grey Worm : No, not death. I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath.

Missandei : Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.

Daenerys Targaryen : If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?

Missandei : Your Grace, I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters.

Daenerys Targaryen : You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?

Missandei : I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace. . I have seen you listen to your counselors. I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you. And I have seen you ignore your counselors, because there was a better choice. One that only you could see.

Hizdahr : My, my queen, please do not do this.

Daenerys Targaryen : What about "Valar Morghulis"?

Hizdahr : I did not want to die a coward. Apparently I do not want to die at all. .

Daenerys Targaryen : It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live.

Hizdahr : Yes, my queen.

Daenerys Targaryen : And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. . Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.

Tyrion Lannister : Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. . Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.

Jorah Mormont : We are.

Tyrion Lannister : What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.

Jorah Mormont : No wine.

Tyrion Lannister : I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not.

Tyrion Lannister : I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.

Jorah Mormont : I am.

Tyrion Lannister : Have you sailed this route before?

Jorah Mormont : No.

Tyrion Lannister : You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?

Jorah Mormont : I think you'll be plenty.

Tyrion Lannister : You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?

Jorah Mormont : No. But the pirates are.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh.

Tyrion Lannister : The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -

Jorah Mormont : And then they weren't.

Tyrion Lannister : And then they weren't. "They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned "-

Jorah Mormont : The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned.

Tyrion Lannister : I would clap.

Tyrion Lannister : I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains.

Tyrion Lannister : What was that?

Jorah Mormont : Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!

Jorah Mormont : Get behind!

Tyrion Lannister : Mormont, cut me free! . Mormont!

Tyrion Lannister : Mormont! Mormont!

Jorah Mormont : Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.

Jorah Mormont : You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?

Tyrion Lannister : You? . I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that.

Jorah Mormont : I suppose that's why they send them there.

Tyrion Lannister : It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. . Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. . So what now?

Jorah Mormont : We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat.

Tyrion Lannister : Without luck?

Jorah Mormont : We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?

Tyrion Lannister : That's the best idea you've had all day.

Arya Stark : What are they doing with the bodies?

Waif : Get back to work.

Arya Stark : No! I've been here for weeks. I'm not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I'm doing it.

Waif : You will know why.

Arya Stark : When?

Waif : When it's time. Not before. Get back to work.

Arya Stark : When do I get to play the game?

Waif : Game?

Arya Stark : The game. The game of faces.

Waif : You tried already. You failed.

Arya Stark : I didn't even know I was playing.

Waif : Who are you?

Arya Stark : No one.

Arya Stark : Well who are you? What are you doing here? How'd you get here?

Waif : I'm from Westeros. Just like you. Daughter of a Lord. Just like you. Except I was an only child. Heir to his fortune. My mother died. My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl. My stepmother didn't want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison. I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again. I've been serving them ever since.

Waif : Was that true or a lie?

Arya Stark : What?

Waif : Did you believe every word I said?

Jaqen Hghar : Who are you?

Arya Stark : Arya.

Jaqen Hghar : And where did you come from?

Arya Stark : Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle.

Jaqen Hghar : A lie.

Arya Stark : After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back.

Arya Stark : I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver.

Arya Stark : A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn't. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him.

Arya Stark : I hated him.

Arya Stark : I hated him!

Arya Stark : That's not a lie!

Jaqen Hghar : The girl lies. To me. To the Many Faced God. To herself. Does she truly want to be no one?

Arya Stark : Yes.

Arya Stark : I'm not playing this stupid game anymore!

Jaqen Hghar : We never stop playing.

Tyrion Lannister : So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can't live on berries and roots.

Jorah Mormont : I can.

Tyrion Lannister : You're not hungry?

Jorah Mormont : Of course I'm hungry.

Tyrion Lannister : You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met.

Jorah Mormont : I am not your travelling companion.

Tyrion Lannister : We are travelling together. In each other's company. Therefore.

Jorah Mormont : Do you ever shut up?

Tyrion Lannister : I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.

Jorah Mormont : Why?

Tyrion Lannister : Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.

Jorah Mormont : I'm sure you've visited many brothels in many cities.

Tyrion Lannister : I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.

Tyrion Lannister : As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man.

Jorah Mormont : What do you know about my father?

Tyrion Lannister : I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? "We shall never see his like again."�

Tyrion Lannister : You didn't know. I'm sorry. I am.

Jorah Mormont : How?

Tyrion Lannister : I only know what I heard

Tyrion Lannister : He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.

Jorah Mormont : We better keep moving.

Man : Valar morghulis.

Arya Stark : Valar dohaeris.

Man : I have nowhere else to go. I've taken her to every healer in Braavos. I've spent every penny I had. She suffers every day of her life. I just want it to end.

Girl : It hurts.

Arya Stark : I know. Don't be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me.

Arya Stark : I've devoted my life to him now. You don't want to hurt anymore. Drink.

Jaqen Hghar : Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?

Jaqen Hghar : No. The girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else.

Tyrion Lannister : Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion.

Jorah Mormont : Do you believe in anything?

Tyrion Lannister : I believe in many things.

Jorah Mormont : In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?

Tyrion Lannister : No.

Jorah Mormont : Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I'd find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?

Jorah Mormont : It's hard to be a cynic after that.

Tyrion Lannister : Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.

Jorah Mormont : No it doesn't.

Tyrion Lannister : The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?

Jorah Mormont : First we have to conquer the world.

Tyrion Lannister : We? Alright, let's assume your dreams come true. She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?

Jorah Mormont : Then she rules.

Tyrion Lannister : So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?

Jorah Mormont : She is the rightful heir.

Tyrion Lannister : Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?

Jorah Mormont : Shh! It's a slave ship

Tyrion Lannister : Why is it anchored?

Jorah Mormont : They probably came ashore for--

Malko : water.

Sam Tarly : PLACE - LATER

Malko : Got a lot of fight in you, huh?

Slaver : Salt mines.

Malko : That or a galley slave. He looks strong enough.

Slaver : What about the dwarf?

Malko : Worthless. Cut his throat.

Tyrion Lannister : Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let's discuss this!

Malko : And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf's cock has magic powers.

Tyrion Lannister : Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?

Slaver : It will be a dwarf-sized cock.

Tyrion Lannister : Guess again.

Malko : The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.

Jorah Mormont : Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.

Malko : We're bound to Volantis, not Slaver's Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits.

Tyrion Lannister : The fighting puts in Mereen! You're in luck then, you're about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms.

Tyrion Lannister : Him.

Malko : Him? He's got to be 60 years old.

Tyrion Lannister : Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!

Malko : Is that true?

Tyrion Lannister : He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.

Tyrion Lannister : The Kingslayer!

Malko : Jousting. You're talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.

Jorah Mormont : I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.

Malko : Liar.

Jorah Mormont : It's no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand, I'll prove my worth.

Lancel : Lord Baelish.

Petyr Baelish : Yes? Lancel Lannister.

Lancel : Brother Lancel. We abandoned our family names.

Petyr Baelish : That's quite a family to abandon.

Lancel : The city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run.

Petyr Baelish : Well done.

Petyr Baelish : I'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I'll be delayed?

Lancel : Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You'll find that there's little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing.

Petyr Baelish : We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining.

Petyr Baelish : Do you think it's wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?

Cersei Lannister : The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.

Petyr Baelish : Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.

Cersei Lannister : The King's orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras' perversion?

Petyr Baelish : House Tyrell won't tolerate these insults.

Cersei Lannister : House Tyrell won't tolerate it? I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys.

Petyr Baelish : One's choice of companion is a curious thing.

Cersei Lannister : Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you're still in mourning.

Petyr Baelish : Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.

Cersei Lannister : She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him.

Petyr Baelish : I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.

Cersei Lannister : If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?

Petyr Baelish : Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.

Cersei Lannister : Good. If there's nothing else.

Petyr Baelish : There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell.

Cersei Lannister : That's not possible.

Petyr Baelish : My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen.

Cersei Lannister : Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.

Petyr Baelish : Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.

Cersei Lannister : We were fools to trust a turncloak.

Petyr Baelish : Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.

Cersei Lannister : I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.

Petyr Baelish : I would counsel patience, your grace.

Cersei Lannister : Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor.

Petyr Baelish : Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they're done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.

Cersei Lannister : Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn.

Petyr Baelish : That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.

Cersei Lannister : My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.

Petyr Baelish : Ser Jaime, then.

Cersei Lannister : Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I've no idea when he'll be back.

Petyr Baelish : Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow.

Cersei Lannister : Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man.

Petyr Baelish : You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?

Cersei Lannister : And if you succeed?

Petyr Baelish : Name me Warden of the North.

Cersei Lannister : I'll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.

Petyr Baelish : I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.

Cersei Lannister : And I'll l know you're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.

Petyr Baelish : As I said. I live to serve.

Trystane : I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

Myrcella : What if he says no?

Trystane : He won't. You've waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?

Myrcella : Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you.

Myrcella : We can't. Not yet.

Trystane : Why not?

Myrcella : You know why not. Someone will see.

Trystane : You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together.

Myrcella : How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?

Trystane : I like the way your eyes go squinty when you're jealous.

Myrcella : They don't go squinty, and you didnt answer the question.

Doran : They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them.

Areo : Yes, my prince.

Doran : You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how.

Areo : I remember how.

Bronn : The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman's blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...

Jaime Lannister : Alright, thats enough.

Bronn : I'm coming to the best part.

Jaime Lannister : We're trying to blend in. We don't want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.

Bronn : This song really is all about the ending.

Jaime Lannister : It can wait. Up there.

Jaime Lannister : That's the Water Gardens.

Bronn : Once we got the princess, then what?

Jaime Lannister : I like to improvise.

Bronn : That explains the golden hand.

Ellaria : Unbowed, unbent, unbroken. For Oberyn.

Sand Snakes : For Oberyn.

Bronn : Well, she's made herself at home.

Jaime Lannister : Myrcella.

Myrcella : Uncle Jaime? I don't understand, what are you doing here?

Jaime Lannister : Let's speak in private.

Trystane : I am Trystane Martell.

Myrcella : Trystane is my intended.

Jaime Lannister : Excellent. Good to meet you.

Trystane : We weren't expecting you, Ser Jaime.

Bronn : Why don't you let them have some time alone, son?

Bronn : Let's not do something stupid.

Myrcella : No!

Bronn : That was something stupid.

Jaime Lannister : We have to go, Myrcella, now.

Myrcella : You hurt him!

Jaime Lannister : You'll be fine, I promise, but we have to--

Bronn : Oh for fuck's sake.

Obara : You're coming with me.

Myrcella : I don't want to!

Obara : I wasn't asking, princess.

Areo : Drop you weapons!

Obara : I am Obara Sand. Daughter of Oberyn Martell. I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?

Areo : Drop your weapons!

Areo : When you were whole, it would have been a good fight.

Bronn : You fight pretty good for a little girl.

Rider : Halt!

Olenna Tyrell : Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on.

Olenna Tyrell : Rumors and gossip, that's all they got. It's theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else.

Margaery Tyrell : Everyone knew about him and Renly.

Olenna Tyrell : Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.

Margaery Tyrell : But he was the king's brother.

Olenna Tyrell : And Loras is the queen's brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable.

Margaery Tyrell : Cersei is behind this.

Olenna Tyrell : Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister.

Olenna Tyrell : Your Grace, I have travelled a long way.

Cersei Lannister : You must be exhausted.

Olenna Tyrell : Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren't writing anything.

Cersei Lannister : Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns.

Olenna Tyrell : And the famous tart Queen Cersei.

Cersei Lannister : Beg your pardon.

Olenna Tyrell : I know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.

Cersei Lannister : If you apologize for that comment perhaps--

Olenna Tyrell : You'll get your apology when I get Loras.

Cersei Lannister : I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?

Olenna Tyrell : Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?

Cersei Lannister : I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--

Olenna Tyrell : Do you expect the alliance to continue after you've thrown our future into prison?

Cersei Lannister : As I said, i didn't imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--

Olenna Tyrell : What veil?

Cersei Lannister : The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?

Olenna Tyrell : I didn't trust your father. I didn't particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.

Cersei Lannister : House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I'm sure they don't. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna.

Sparrow : You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?

Loras : I don't pay attention to rumors.

Sparrow : You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis' army closed in

Loras : He was my friend. He was my king.

Sparrow : Wasn't Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly.

Loras : I was wrong to support Renly's claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.

Sparrow : Wearing Renly's armor.

Loras : Why does it matter what I wore?

Sparrow : Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy.

Loras : Of course I deny them.

Sparrow : You never lay with Renly Baratheon.

Loras : Never.

Sparrow : Nor any other man.

Sparrow : That will be all Ser Loras.

Olenna Tyrell : Well I think that's quite enough of that.

Sparrow : Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.

Margaery Tyrell : You call me forward?

Sparrow : Yes. We have some questions for you.

Margaery Tyrell : I am the queen.

Sparrow : You are. And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest.

Sparrow : How do you respond to these charges against your brother?

Margaery Tyrell : They are lies.

Sparrow : All of them?

Margaery Tyrell : All of them.

Sparrow : Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?

Margaery Tyrell : Yes, I swear it.

Sparrow : Thank you, your grace.

Sparrow : Do you know this man?

Olyvar : Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden.

Sparrow : How did you come to meet?

Olyvar : I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.

Sparrow : And what occurred in his chamber?

Olyvar : We engaged in intimate relations.

Sparrow : You laid with him?

Olyvar : That night and many others.

Loras : Liar! He's a liar!

Sparrow : Is there anyone else who can support your claim?

Olyvar : Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn't seem surprised.

Cersei Lannister : This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?

Olyvar : He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne.

Loras : Liar!

Olenna Tyrell : What are you doing? Let us pass.

Sparrow : The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.

Margaery Tyrell : What?

Sparrow : Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any. Take her.

Margaery Tyrell : Tommen! Tommen!

Margaery Tyrell : You can't do this, I am the queen! Tommen, Tommen! I am your queen, how dare you!

Sansa Stark : What do you want?

Myranda : Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don't you?

Myranda : You're so beautiful. But if you need to keep him happy. Ramsay gets bored easily. You dont want to end up like... Well, like the others.

Sansa Stark : What others?

Myranda : I shouldn't gossip. It's good to see the red again. No point in hiding anymore.

Myranda : Let's see. There was Kiera. The blacksmith's daughter. She was tall. Like you. Lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and. Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don't they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.

Sansa Stark : Hunt?

Myranda : Mm. Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty. But it's your wedding day, why am I talking about such things?

Sansa Stark : What was your name again?

Myranda : Myranda.

Sansa Stark : And how long have you loved him, Myranda. Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? Then I came along and ruined it. I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can't frighten me.

Myranda : Are you done with your bath, my lady?

Sansa Stark : Go. I can finish on my own.

Sansa Stark : Yes?

Theon Greyjoy : I've come to escort you to the Godswood, my lady. If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?

Sansa Stark : No.

Theon Greyjoy : Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.

Sansa Stark : I'm not touching you.

Theon Greyjoy : Please. He'll punish me.

Sansa Stark : Do you think I care what he does to you.

Roose : Who comes before the Old Gods this night?

Theon Greyjoy : Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown, trueborn and noble. She comes to beg the blessings of the gods. Who comes to claim her?

Ramsay Bolton : Ramsay of House Bolton. Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell. Who gives her?

Theon Greyjoy : Theon of House Greyjoy. Who was. who was her father's ward.

Roose : Lady Sansa, will you take this man?

Sansa Stark : I take this man.

Ramsay Bolton : Are you pleased my lady?

Ramsay Bolton : Good. I want you to be happy. My father said you're still a virgin.

Sansa Stark : Yes.

Ramsay Bolton : Why? Why are you still a virgin? Afraid of dwarves?

Sansa Stark : Lord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me.

Ramsay Bolton : You're not lying to me?

Sansa Stark : No, my lord.

Ramsay Bolton : Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage. We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don't you think?

Sansa Stark : Yes sir.

Ramsay Bolton : Good. Now take off your clothes.

Ramsay Bolton : Oh, no no no. You stay here Reek. You watch. Do I need to ask a second time? I hate asking a second time.

Ramsay Bolton : Reek? I told you to watch.

Ramsay Bolton : You've known Sansa since she was a girl. Now watch her become a woman.

End : EPISODE

Jon Snow : First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black.

Alliser : Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy, and an insult to all of the Brothers that have died fighting the wildlings.

Jon Snow : As always, thank you for your honesty.

Sam : Safe travels, Lord Commander.

Jon Snow : Thank you, Sam.

Sam : Oh, and.

Sam : It's Dragonglass. It's what I used to kill the White Walker. I hope you don't need them.

Jon Snow : Me too.

Aemon : There he is. That laugh. Egg! Egg laughed like that. One of the first things I remember about him.

Sam : His little brother, Aegon. He became king.

Aemon : And before that, he was a jolly fellow. Like this one.

Aemon : Get him south, Gillyflower. Before it's too late.

Sansa Stark : Theon, wait.

Theon Greyjoy : Not Theon, my lady. Reek.

Sansa Stark : Help me.

Theon Greyjoy : You're his wife now.

Sansa Stark : Theon

Theon Greyjoy : Do what he says. Do what he says or he'll hurt you.

Sansa Stark : He already hurts me every night. All day I'm locked in this room and every night he comes. It can't be worse.

Theon Greyjoy : It can. It can always be worse.

Sansa Stark : What did he do to you?

Theon Greyjoy : Please.

Sansa Stark : You betrayed my family!

Theon Greyjoy : I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

Sansa Stark : You have to help me!

Theon Greyjoy : He'll see us. You don't know him.

Sansa Stark : My family still has friends in the North. All I have to do is give a signal and they'll rescue me. Climb to the top of the Broken Tower, light this candle, and put it in the window. Promise me, Theon.

Theon Greyjoy : Reek, my lady, Reek!

Sansa Stark : Your name is Theon Greyjoy. Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, do you hear me? Theon. Promise me.

Ramsay Bolton : Yes, Reek?

Aemon : Egg! Egg! Mothers looking for you! Egg!

Gilly : Get some sleep, Sam. You'll have to speak for him tomorrow.

Sam : You don't know that.

Gilly : Get some sleep. I'll watch over him.

Sam : I'll stay too. He's always been good to me. I can't leave him now.

Aemon : Egg! Egg.. I dreamed... that I was old

Sam : His name was Aemon Targaryen. He came to us from King's Landing, a Maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn. And a sworn brother of the Night's Watch, ever faithful. No man was wiser or gentler or kinder. At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. And now his watch has ended.

Brothers : And now his watch has ended.

Alliser : You're losing all your friends, Tarly.

Ramsay Bolton : My beautiful wife.

Ramsay Bolton : When my father told me we were marrying I half expected a fat, bearded beast. Do you know how pleased I was when I saw you? You've made me very happy.

Ramsay Bolton : Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell. He's a respected commander. His troops are loyal and battle tested. He's hired thousands of foreign sell swords to bolster his army. But this storm was a stroke of luck for us northerners. Our people are used to fighting in frost. His army's out there now, suffering in the snow. One day I'll be Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North. You'll be my Lady and Wardeness.

Sansa Stark : But isn't your step mother pregnant?

Ramsay Bolton : What of it?

Sansa Stark : What happens if she has a boy?

Ramsay Bolton : Then I'll have a baby brother.

Sansa Stark : But he'll be the heir.

Ramsay Bolton : I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.

Sansa Stark : But you're a bastard, a true born will always have the stronger claim.

Ramsay Bolton : I've been naturalized by a royal decree of--

Sansa Stark : Tommen Baratheon. Another bastard.

Ramsay Bolton : Bastards can rise high in the world. Like your half-brother Jon Snow. Born The Bastard of Winterfell, now the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

Ramsay Bolton : You didn't know? Yes, he's done very well for himself. Ah. I near forgot why I asked you to join me. Come, my lady.

Ramsay Bolton : Your Northern friend. Reek told me you wanted to leave.

Ramsay Bolton : Why? Winterfell is your home and I am your husband.

Ramsay Bolton : Tough old bird. Everyone talks when I start beating them. But this one. Her heart gave out before I got to her face. We do breed them tough in the North. Bring my wife back to her chamber. It's far too cold out here for a lady. You should hold on to your candles. The nights are so long now.

Davos : 40 horses died in the night. We'll lose more come sunset. We're running out of food. We can't open the supply line until the snow clears.

Stannis Baratheon : What else?

Davos : The Stormcrows rode off last night.

Stannis Baratheon : 500 men.

Stannis Baratheon : Sell swords, loyal to nothing but gold.

Davos : We still have a hard march to Wintefell and we won't be marching anywhere in this weather.

Stannis Baratheon : And?

Davos : This isn't our time, we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears.

Stannis Baratheon : I retreated from King's Landing, Ser Davos. If I retreat again, I become "The King Who Ran."�

Davos : Your Grace..

Stannis Baratheon : Winter is coming. Those arent just the Stark words, it's a fact. If we march back to Castle Black, we winter at Castle Black. And who can say how many years this winter will last.

Davos : It's better to wait for the right time than to risk everything.

Stannis Baratheon : This is the right time, and I will risk everything. Because if I don't, we've lost. We march to victory or we march to defeat, but we go forward only forward,

Davos : Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : I've trusted in your visions, in your prophecies for years.

Melisandre : You saw it yourself, my king, when you stared into the flames. A great battle in the snow.

Stannis Baratheon : I don't know what I saw.

Melisandre : You do know. Trust yourself.

Stannis Baratheon : And you, do you trust yourself?

Melisandre : I trust in the Lord.

Stannis Baratheon : Are you sure?

Melisandre : I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell. I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground.

Melisandre : But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory. I have shown you the power of king's blood. The Usurper Robb Stark. The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

Stannis Baratheon : We don't have Robert's bastard here.

Melisandre : No, we have someone better, and your blood runs through her veins.

Stannis Baratheon : Have you lost your mind?

Melisandre : Do you doubt me still? After all that you've seen?

Stannis Baratheon : There must be another way. Leeches or something.

Melisandre : There is only one way. You must become king before the Long Night begins. Only you can lead the living against the dead. All your life has led us to this moment. To this decision.

Stannis Baratheon : She's my daughter.

Stannis Baratheon : Get out.

Derryk : The beauty from beyond The Wall.

Bran Stark : Where are you going, huh? Aren't we better looking than the fat man?

Derryk : The question is, is she pretty down south in the real world, or is she pretty because she's the only girl here?

Bran Stark : Even in White Harbor, I'd want a kiss.

Derryk : Come on love, give us a kiss.

Gilly : Leave me alone.

Derryk : If you were my girl I wouldn't leave you alone.

Bran Stark : One little kiss.

Derryk : Come on, give him a kiss.

Bran Stark : A man gets lonely guarding the Wall.

Bran Stark : There's no need to be rude.

Derryk : We just want a little affection.

Sam : Get your hands off her. Brother Derryk. Brother Brand. I believe you both have guard duty tonight.

Bran Stark : Sam the Slayer. Are you gonna slay me with that sword?

Derryk : Look at his hands shaking.

Sam : Gilly go on, Get back to your room and lock the door.

Sam : I'm warning you.

Derryk : Come on! Come on!

Derryk : You lying sack of shit! Killed a White Walker, eh? You fatass fuck. Come on, get up. He's your hero. He's a hog!

Gilly : Leave him alone!

Derryk : Stubborn little wilding bitch aren't ya?

Gilly : Sam! Sam! Sam!

Bran Stark : Alright. Hold still.

Sam : I said get your hands off her.

Bran Stark : You're gonna get yourself killed.

Derryk : Roll over. Jon Snow's not here to save you.

Sam : I killed a White Walker. I killed a Thenn. I'll take my chances with you.

Gilly : Sam!

Sam : I'm alright.

Gilly : You're not.

Sammy : Just a bit woozy.

Gilly : The next time you see something like that you leave it alone.

Sam : I will not. They wouldo ve. I don't know what they would have done

Gilly : I know they would have killed you if Ghost hadn't come.

Sam : No. They were tiring out. I had them in the palm of my hand.

Gilly : Don't be stupid Sam, you're not a fighter.

Sam : What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?

Gilly : Just promise me that whatever happens you'll take care of little Sam.

Sam : Of course I will. And I'll take care of you, too.

Gilly : I need more water.

Sam : Stay. Please.

Gilly : Am I hurting you?

Gilly : Are you sure?

Sam : Oh. Oh my.

Malko : A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends. Not your usual street tough old drunken pirate. This one's a Westerosi knight from an ancient house, trained in sword and lance. he fought beside the Stag King Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first from the breach during the siege of Pyke, slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. Betrayed by his woman, he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.

Malko : 13. Do I have 14?

Malko : 15? 15 golds honors. Do I have 16?

Slave Buyer : 20

Malko : Sold!

Tyrion Lannister : Wait! You have to buy me as well.

Buyer : Why?

Tyrion Lannister : We're a team. I'm a great fighter, too.

Malko : He's funny. You have to give him that.

Buyer : Alright. He's funny.

Tyrion Lannister : Thank you my Lord. Thank you.

Buyer : Yes.

Tyrion Lannister : My Lord, if I may. I've heard Mereen's become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage.

Buer : Here's your wages, funny man. It'll last the rest of your life.

Daario : How long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow?

Daenerys Targaryen : Don't be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he's smart enough to understand that.

Daario : I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.

Daenerys Targaryen : Are you jealous?

Daario : Do you think I'm petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?

Daenerys Targaryen : I do.

Daario : You're right. My motivations are entirely impure.

Daario : Doesn't make me wrong.

Daenerys Targaryen : You told me yourself, I can't fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice.

Daario : Everyone has a choice. Even slaves have a choice. Death or slavery.

Daenerys Targaryen : So what else can I do?

Daario : Marry me instead.

Daenerys Targaryen : Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn't.

Daario : Why not? You're our queen, you can do as you like.

Daenerys Targaryen : No. I can't

Daario : Then you are the only person in Mereen who's not free.

Daario : I know I'm here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?

Daenerys Targaryen : Of course

Daario : On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all.

Daenerys Targaryen : I am a queen. Not a butcher.

Daario : All rulers are either butchers or meat.

Olenna Tyrell : You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he's got.

Sparrow : It's not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I'll admit.

Olenna Tyrell : You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.

Sparrow : You should have the decency to kneel before the gods

Olenna Tyrell : Don't spar with me little fellow.

Sparrow : For me, it's the knees. You?

Olenna Tyrell : Hips.

Sparrow : Huh.

Olenna Tyrell : A man of the people, is that your game? It's an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei's dirty work for her.

Sparrow : The people always do the dirty work.

Olenna Tyrell : Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away.

Sparrow : A useful talent.

Olenna Tyrell : I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.

Sparrow : Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied. The Father judges us all. Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen. If you break his laws you will be punished.

Olenna Tyrell : Don't you walk away from me.

Sparrow : You don't give commands here, Lady Olenna.

Olenna Tyrell : What is it you want? Gold? I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.

Olenna Tyrell : What then?

Sparrow : I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But I'm telling you a simple truth

Olenna Tyrell : How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?

Sparrow : By the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you don't have one in your library I'll give you my own.

Olenna Tyrell : I've read the seven pointed star.

Sparrow : Then you'll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.

Olenna Tyrell : Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?

Sparrow : Yes. The Gods' laws must be applied to all equally.

Olenna Tyrell : If it's equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I'll make sure the hungry know who to blame,

Sparrow : Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few. We are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few.

Squire : Lady Olenna.

Cersei Lannister : Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love.

Tommen Lannister : She's in a prison cell and there's nothing I can do. I am the king! The queen is in prison and there's nothing I can do!

Cersei Lannister : No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control.

Tommen Lannister : I'll call in the army. I'll take back the sept and kill every last one of them. I'll start a war if I have to.

Cersei Lannister : You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.

Tommen Lannister : I love her. I love her. I can't help her.

Cersei Lannister : We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.

Tommen Lannister : I will speak to the high sparrow. There must be something--

Cersei Lannister : Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.

Cersei Lannister : Your happiness is all I want in this world

Tommen Lannister : I know.

Cersei Lannister : No you don't. You can't possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy.

Areo : Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess's wellbeing.

Myrcella : You looked different when I left. You had more hair.

Jaime Lannister : And more hands. How's Trystane?

Myrcella : He'll be alright.

Jaime Lannister : I'm sorry for that. It wasn't supposed to happen that way.

Myrcella : Why is it happening at all?

Jaime Lannister : Your mother's worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I've come to take you home.

Myrcella : This is my home, this has been my home for years. I didn't want to come here but she told me to. I did what she said, I did my duty and now she's forcing me to go back?

Jaime Lannister : It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.

Myrcella : It's not complicated at all, it's simple. I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him, and we're staying right here.

Jaime Lannister : I don't understand.

Myrcella : Of course you don't! You don't know me!

Bronn : Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman's taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I've tasted the Dornishman's wife! Yes I've tasted the Dornishman's wife!

Tyene : He's got a good voice.

Obara : We're lucky he's a singer. If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble.

Bronn : It's against my code to hurt a woman.

Obara : It's amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.

Bronn : I wouldn't say you beat me.

Tyene : How's your arm?

Bronn : Wonderful. Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.

Tyene : You think you're leaving Dorne?

Bronn : No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.

Tyene : Thank you.

Bronn : I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.

Tyene : I'm not the most beautiful woman you've ever seen?

Bronn : I've seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.

Tyene : Name one more beautiful than I am.

Bronn : Well now, in King's Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous...

Tyene : There was a what? In King's Landing you were saying.

Bronn : Was I?

Tyene : There was a woman more beautiful than I am.

Bronn : Was there? My memory's not what it was earlier.

Tyene : How's your arm now?

Bronn : You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.

Tyene : And how about your head?

Bronn : My head. You don't even wanna know what's going on in.

Tyene : Your nose is bleeding.

Bronn : It's nothing. It's the dry air.

Tyene : My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death.

Tyene : The only antidote. Who's the most beautiful woman in the world?

Tyene : Sorry? Who?

Bronn : You.

Tyene : Don't drop it.

Tyene : I think you're very handsome as well.

Petyr Baelish : I'm sorry about the locale.

Olenna Tyrell : No you're not.

Petyr Baelish : It felt like the safest place.

Olenna Tyrell : Not for your clientele, clearly.

Petyr Baelish : It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn't exist until we invented them.

Olenna Tyrell : You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?

Petyr Baelish : The past is the past. The future is all that's worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.

Olenna Tyrell : Don't pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you'd return to the capital once things started going wrong.

Petyr Baelish : I promise you..

Olenna Tyrell : I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they'll never even find what's left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?

Petyr Baelish : Cersei summoned me to King's Landing. I dared not refuse her.

Olenna Tyrell : And what did she want?

Petyr Baelish : A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you.

Olenna Tyrell : What kind of gift?

Petyr Baelish : The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.

Slave Owner : Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games. When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station. But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen. So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today. Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something.

Owner : You and you, you, you two, you, you, and you.

Owner : Valar morghulis.

Men : Valar dohaeris.

Owner : Prepare yourselves.

Daenerys Targaryen : Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.

Hizdahr : For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence.

Owner : Move yourselves!

Owner : Your Grace. Your Future Grace. You honor us all.

Owner : We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen."�

Men : We fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen."�

Daenerys Targaryen : I think I've seen enough.

Hizdahr : Your Grace, it's a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged.

Daenerys Targaryen : I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.

Tyrion Lannister : What are you doing?

Daenerys Targaryen : Get him out of my sight.

Jorah Mormont : Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift.

Tyrion Lannister : It's true. He has.

Daenerys Targaryen : Who are you?

Tyrion Lannister : I am the gift. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister.

Cersei Lannister : This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It's quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind.

Margaery Tyrell : I know you did this.

Cersei Lannister : We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.

Margaery Tyrell : Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You're not very good at those, I'm afraid. Perhaps that's why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me.

Cersei Lannister : You're upset. You're not thinking clearly. I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.

Margaery Tyrell : I don't want to see you again.

Cersei Lannister : I do hope you change your mind about that. I've been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins.

Margaery Tyrell : Leave.

Cersei Lannister : Yes, I'm afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever.

Margaery Tyrell : Get out you hateful bitch!

Cersei Lannister : Sleep well, sister.

Sparrow : Thank you. You saw her?

Cersei Lannister : Yes.

Sparrow : And?

Cersei Lannister : Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?

Sparrow : Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.

Cersei Lannister : Who will stand judge?

Sparrow : Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.

Cersei Lannister : Will you be one of them?

Sparrow : I will.

Cersei Lannister : If one or both of them were to confess before the trial.

Sparrow : Then they will be at The Mother's mercy.

Cersei Lannister : What does The Mother's mercy entail?

Sparrow : It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition.

Cersei Lannister : Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.

Sparrow : Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing?

Cersei Lannister : I think I may have heard at one point.

Sparrow : Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.

Sparrow : Who carved this altar do you know?

Cersei Lannister : I'm afraid i don't.

Sparrow : No one does. There's no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn't inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.

Sparrow : A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird.

Sparrow : And he has much to say about you.

Cersei Lannister : Move. Let me go immediately.

Cersei Lannister : You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy. I am the queen! Let me go!

Cersei Lannister : Look at me. Look at my face. It's the last thing you'll see before you die.

End : EPISODE

Jorah Mormont : Your Grace, I want to say--

Daenerys Targaryen : You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?

Tyrion Lannister : If only I were otherwise.

Daenerys Targaryen : If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn't I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine

Tyrion Lannister : You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.

Daenerys Targaryen : So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?

Tyrion Lannister : Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.

Daenerys Targaryen : If you'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.

Tyrion Lannister : When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.

Daenerys Targaryen : And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?

Tyrion Lannister : Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.

Daenerys Targaryen : I have a very large army and very large dragons.

Tyrion Lannister : Killing and politics aren't always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.

Daenerys Targaryen : So you want to advise me. Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.

Tyrion Lannister : I know.

Daenerys Targaryen : Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?

Tyrion Lannister : Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you.

Tyrion Lannister : Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?

Daenerys Targaryen : Yes, many opportunities.

Tyrion Lannister : And did he?

Daenerys Targaryen : No. Not until forced to do so.

Tyrion Lannister : He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him.

Daenerys Targaryen : So I should kill him?

Tyrion Lannister : A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do.

Daenerys Targaryen : Remove Ser Jorah from the city.

Septa : Confess.

Cersei Lannister : My son. Let me speak to--

Septa : Confess. I meant it.

Cersei Lannister : My face will be the last thing you see before--

Arya Stark : My name is Lana. I'm an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more.

Arya Stark : Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--

Arya Stark : Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade.

Jaqen Hghar : Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.

Arya Stark : How will she serve him?

Jaqen Hghar : She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.

Arya Stark : What will she do there?

Jaqen Hghar : She will see.

Arya Stark : See what?

Jaqen Hghar : How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her.

Arya Stark : Oysters, clams and cockles!

Arya Stark : Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!

Thin Man : Your oysters fresh?

Arya Stark : Best in the city.

Thin Man : You wouldn't lie to an old man would you?

Thin Man : Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.

Man : It's my 18th voyage. I've returned from all of them without a scratch on me.

Thin Man : Can't do it.

Man : Please I have 3 children. Without me-- here take it you have to, I have 3 children, what will they do? Please you have to! Please! You don't understand?

Jaqen Hghar : The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.

Arya Stark : So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?

Jaqen Hghar : A girl tells a man that she has seen.

Arya Stark : If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money.

Jaqen Hghar : But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn't have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?

Arya Stark : The Many Faced God. You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.

Jaqen Hghar : A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.

Arya Stark : And then what?

Jaqen Hghar : A gift for the Thin Man.

Waif : She is not ready.

Jaqen Hghar : Perhaps she is, perhaps she's not.

Waif : And if she's not?

Jaqen Hghar : It is all the same to the Many Faced God.

Qyburn : The trial will take place. The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you.

Cersei Lannister : The charges?

Qyburn : Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert.

Cersei Lannister : All lies.

Qyburn : Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you'll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason.

Cersei Lannister : I wish you'd said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?

Qyburn : I'm afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council.

Cersei Lannister : Tell him I need to speak to him.

Qyburn : I implored him to visit you but he would not.

Cersei Lannister : What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--

Qyburn : Your arrest, and Queen Margaery's arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched.

Cersei Lannister : You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother.

Qyburn : I tried my grace, he wouldn't see me. He wouldn't see anyone.

Cersei Lannister : I can't stay here.

Qyburn : There is a way, Your Grace. A way out.

Cersei Lannister : Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won't. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness.

Qyburn : Goodbye my queen. The work continues.

Sansa Stark : Why. Why Theon.

Theon Greyjoy : Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.

Sansa Stark : Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?

Theon Greyjoy : I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left.

Sansa Stark : Good. If it weren't for you I'd still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would.

Theon Greyjoy : I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.

Theon Greyjoy : They weren't "those boys"�, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you'd know them since they were born.

Theon Greyjoy : They weren't. They were only--

Sansa Stark : Only what?

Theon Greyjoy : I can't..

Sansa Stark : Tell me!

Theon Greyjoy : I can't, not unless the master says...

Sansa Stark : Tell me, they weren't what?!

Theon Greyjoy : They weren't...

Sansa Stark : Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren't your brothers!

Theon Greyjoy : They weren't Bran and Rickon! I couldn't find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.

Sansa Stark : You didn't.?

Sansa Stark : Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?

Theon Greyjoy : I can't talk to you anymore.

Sansa Stark : Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--

Theon Greyjoy : Not Theon, Reek!

Bolton Bannerman : Our scouts tells us he's got no more than 6000 men. More than half of them are mounted, however.

Roose : And how high can Stannis' horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny.

Roose : You disagree?

Ramsay Bolton : Stannis isn't from the North. You are, father. I think you're missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders.

Roose : And what do you recommend?

Ramsay Bolton : That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows.

Roose : A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can't touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn't get an army through if we wanted to.

Ramsay Bolton : I don't need an army. I need 20 good men.

Daenerys Targaryen : So have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service?

Tyrion Lannister : Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?

Daenerys Targaryen : It's probably my safest option.

Tyrion Lannister : I can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done.

Daenerys Targaryen : And what would your father do?

Tyrion Lannister : My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.

Daenerys Targaryen : Is that why you killed him?

Tyrion Lannister : Some day if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this.

Daenerys Targaryen : I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.

Tyrion Lannister : So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers.

Daenerys Targaryen : I'm terrible?

Tyrion Lannister : I've heard stories.

Daenerys Targaryen : Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?

Tyrion Lannister : To see if you were the right kind of terrible.

Daenerys Targaryen : Which kind is that?

Tyrion Lannister : The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.

Daenerys Targaryen : I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed.

Daenerys Targaryen : Perhaps it won't come to that.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.

Daenerys Targaryen : Varys? King Robert's spy master?

Tyrion Lannister : Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.

Daenerys Targaryen : Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.

Tyrion Lannister : He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.

Daenerys Targaryen : But you trust him?

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother.

Daenerys Targaryen : The brother who killed my father.

Tyrion Lannister : That's the one.

Daenerys Targaryen : Perhaps I will have you killed after all.

Tyrion Lannister : Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting.

Daenerys Targaryen : I'm not going to kill you.

Tyrion Lannister : No? Banish me?

Daenerys Targaryen : No.

Tyrion Lannister : So if I'm not going to be murdered, and I'm not going to be banished...

Daenerys Targaryen : You're going to advise me. While you can still speak in complete sentences.

Tyrion Lannister : Advise you on what?

Daenerys Targaryen : How to get what I want.

Tyrion Lannister : The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.

Daenerys Targaryen : If I want jokes I'll get myself a proper fool.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.

Daenerys Targaryen : I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.

Tyrion Lannister : And when you get back to your home, who supports you?

Daenerys Targaryen : The common people.

Tyrion Lannister : Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough.

Daenerys Targaryen : Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground.

Tyrion Lannister : It's a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You're not the first person to have dreamt it.

Daenerys Targaryen : I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel.

Jorah Mormont : You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.

Master : You struck me.

Jorah Mormont : I've been flogged if it makes you happy. I'm the best you've got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?

Master : You're a free man, you could have gone anywhere, why did you come back?

Jorah Mormont : Let me fight for her and I belong to you.

Septa : Thirsty? Confess.

Cersei Lannister : I'll get out of here, you realize. Before long.

Cersei Lannister : I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.

Cersei Lannister : I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die.

Gilly : Does it hurt?

Sam : No.

Gilly : Good.

Sam : How are you?

Gilly : I'm not the one who got punched and kicked in the face.

Sam : You know what I mean.

Gilly : I'm good.

Sam : Are you scared?

Gilly : A little.

Sam : Me too.

Sam : Who's there?

Olly : Olly.

Sam : Come in.

Olly : I heard what happened.

Sam : Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.

Olly : Figured you were hungry.

Sam : You're a good lad.

Olly : Wanted to ask you something. If you've got the time.

Gilly : I need to check on baby Sam.

Sam : Now then. How can I help?

Olly : It's about the Lord Commander.

Sam : Yes?

Olly : He's going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings. Wildlings killed my mom and dad. They killed everyone in my village.

Sam : We've been fighting them for years.

Olly : This wasn't a fight. We were farmers and they slaughtered us. So why's he saving them?

Sam : Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones.

Olly : The one he's travelling with, the one with the red beard, he led the raid on my village.

Sam : Olly...

Olly : How can he trust him?

Sam : I've seen the army of the dead. I've seen the white walkers, and they're coming for us, for all the living. And when it's time we'll need every last man we can find.

Olly : But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep?

Sam : Jon's taking a risk, but he has to. We don't stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run.

Olly : You believe that?

Sam : With all my heart.

Sam : Try not to worry Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.

Tormund : You trust me Jon Snow?

Jon Snow : Does that make me a fool?

Tormund : We are fools together now.

Tormund : Lord of Bones. Been a long time.

Lord Of Bones : Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened?

Tormund : War.

Lord Of Bones : You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king.

Tormund : We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.

Lord Of Bones : You don't give the orders here.

Tormund : I'm not giving an order.

Lord Of Bones : Why aren't you in chains?

Jon Snow : He's not my prisoner.

Lord Of Bones : What is he?

Jon Snow : We're allies.

Lord Of Bones : You fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now.

Tormund : I don't fight for the crows.

Jon Snow : We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.

Lord Of Bones : Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when you're done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock--

Tormund : Gather the elders and let's talk.

Jon Snow : My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there.

Karsi : You built that wall to keep us out.

Loboda : Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?

Jon Snow : In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.

Karsi : Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe.

Jon Snow : It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.

Jon Snow : Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.

Loboda : You saw this?

Jon Snow : No. But I trust the man.

Karsi : There are old stories about Dragonglass.

Loboda : There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.

Karsi : And with the things we've seen you don't believe them?

Jon Snow : Come with me and I'll share these weapons.

Karsi : Come with you where?

Jon Snow : There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.

Jon Snow : I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life.

Karsi : If.?

Jon Snow : If you swear you join us when the real war begins.

Loboda : Where is Mance?

Jon Snow : He died.

Loboda : How?

Jon Snow : I put an arrow through his heart.

Loboda : I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.

Tormund : None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that's what we need today

Karsi : I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows.

Jon Snow : I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight.

Karsi : You vouch for this man, Tormund?

Tormund : He's prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He's young, but he knows how to lead. He didn't have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him.

Loboda : My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.

Karsi : So would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead.

Tormund : This is the way.

Wildling Elder : I'm with Tormund. We stay here we're dead men. At least with King Crow there's a chance.

Giant : Tormund.

Loboda : Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they're gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That's our enemy. That has always been our enemy.

Karsi : I fucking hate Thenns.

Jon Snow : How many are with us? 5000?

Tormund : I'm not good at counting.

Jon Snow : We're leaving too many behind.

Tormund : The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.

Jon Snow : And he knew them better than I ever will.

Tormund : They're running out of food and there's nothing to hunt. They'll come around.

Karsi : Johnna is gonna look after you. She's in charge, you listen to her.

Daughter : I wanna go with you.

Karsi : I need to get the old folks on the boats. I'm right behind you, I promise. Go on.

Wun Wun : Lokh kif rukh?

Loboda : Shut the gate.

Loboda : Shut the gate!!

Shouting : Wait! Open the gate! Let us in! Help us! Please open it!

Loboda : Ready your arrows!

Jon Snow : Get in line! Get in line!

Jon Snow : Hold the line! Hold the line!

Nights Watch Brother : Lord Commander!

Jon Snow : Get them to the ship and come back for me!

Brother : But you'll never make it--

Jon Snow : Now!

Jon Snow : You should be on one of those boats.

Karsi : So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you're not there ?

Jon Snow : You have my word. I've given orders.

Karsi : Don't think you're gonna be there to enforce those orders !

Tormund : If they get through, everyone dies !

Jon Snow : Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!

Jon Snow : The Dragonglass!

Loboda : You're with me, lad! Now!

Loboda : Get the glass.

Edd : Fuck the glass! We're gonna die here.

Jon Snow : Go! Go! Go!

Tormund : Wun Wun, to the sea.

Jon Snow : Let's go now! Now!

End : EPISODE

Davos : A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--

Stannis Baratheon : Horses?

Davos : We're still getting a count, but hundreds are dead.

Stannis Baratheon : 20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?

Davos : The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.

Stannis Baratheon : Put last night's guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them.

Davos : Unless there's a thaw, we can't press forward to Winterfell, and we don't have enough food to get us back to Castle Black.

Stannis Baratheon : We're not returning to Castle Black.

Davos : Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can't march forward, and we won't march back.

Stannis Baratheon : Have the dead horses butchered for meat.

Alliser : Open the gates.

Jon Snow : It was a failure.

Sam : It wasn't.

Jon Snow : I went to save them, I failed.

Sam : You didn't fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else.

Jon Snow : I don't think that fact's lost on them.

Alliser : You have a good heart, Jon Snow. It will get us all killed.

Davos : You sent for me, Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I'm sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I'll make sure the Night's Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes.

Davos : Your Grace, you've named me your Hand.

Stannis Baratheon : Yes.

Davos : The King's Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war.

Stannis Baratheon : You're not abandoning me, you're obeying a command.

Davos : A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.

Stannis Baratheon : And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn't name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don't come back empty handed.

Davos : Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me.

Stannis Baratheon : My family stays with me.

Davos : At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.

Davos : What's this one now?

Shireen : The Dance of Dragons

Davos : Well that sounds like a proper story.

Shireen : Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection.

Davos : But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield.

Shireen : And burnt him to a crisp.

Davos : Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess.

Davos : Do you like it?

Shireen : He's beautiful.

Shireen : Thank you.

Davos : You're very welcome.

Shireen : Will you make me a doe, too, so that he can have company?

Davos : Of course I will.

Shireen : But why am I getting a present?

Davos : Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. I'll be gone for a few days, Princess. I'll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I'm back.

Shireen : You'll just have to read it yourself.

Jaime Lannister : Prince Doran.

Doran : Forgive us, we started without you. Please, sit.

Jaime Lannister : Princess Myrcella.

Myrcella : Uncle.

Jaime Lannister : What a lovely dress.

Myrcella : You don't like it?

Jaime Lannister : You must be cold.

Myrcella : Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.

Jaime Lannister : Prince Trystane. How's your jaw?

Trystane : A fleabite.

Ellaria : What are you doing in Dorne?

Jaime Lannister : Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella.

Doran : And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.

Jaime Lannister : We received a threatening message. The princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper.

Myrcella : That necklace was stolen from my room.

Jaime Lannister : Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.

Doran : We can't behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I've seen war. I've seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I've seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don't want to lead my people into that hell.

Ellaria : No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters.

Doran : And that is precisely what we are doing. Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

Doran : King Tommen insists on his sister's return to the capital?

Jaime Lannister : I'm afraid he does.

Doran : I cannot disobey my King's command. She will return with you to King's Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand.

Jaime Lannister : I accept.

Doran : One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council.

Jaime Lannister : You have my word.

Ellaria : The word of a Kingslayer.

Ellaria : No wonder you can't stand. You have no spine.

Doran : You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you won't.

Jaime Lannister : May I inquire into the fate of my man?

Doran : Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?

Jaime Lannister : He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it's me.

Doran : Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he's to rule one day. I'll let him decide.

Trystane : I have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.

Jaime Lannister : You're a good man.

Trystane : On one condition.

Nymeria : Why do we play? I'm better than you, I'll always be better than you. Have I ever missed once? I don't think, I can't recall. You must love humiliation or pain. Which do you love most? Humiliation or-- -- pain? That one hurt didn't it? You going to cry? Give up, little sister.

Tyene : You're going to miss.

Nymeria : I never miss.

Tyene : You will. You're thinking too much. Now you're nervous. "What if she's right?"�

Nymeria : Luck.

Tyene : Now it's my turn.

Nymeria : You're too slow. You've always been too slow.

Bronn : Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?

Areo : You'll find out very soon.

Tyene : Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?

Bronn : The most beautiful woman in the world.

Tyene : And that's the truth!

Nymeria : Slut.

Jaime Lannister : Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

Bronn : Only the one.

Jaime Lannister : I believe you've already met Prince Trystane.

Bronn : Prince. Sorry about the other day.

Jaime Lannister : Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He's agreed to grant you your freedom.

Bronn : I'm glad to hear it. The pie looks good.

Jaime Lannister : There was one condition.

Doran : Perhaps some soup instead?

Arya Stark : Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--

Man : How much for your little clam?

Arya Stark : Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!

Thin Man : Come on.

Thin Man : Some oysters, girl! I'm talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?!

Banker : Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free.

Mace : Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.

Banker : And how goes the harvest in the Reach?

Mace : Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I'll be sure to send the Arbor's finest your way.

Banker : I'm afraid I don't partake.

Mace : Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course.

Banker : I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.

Mace : Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.

Banker : Most unfortunate for the glovers.

Mace : If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble.

Banker : We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.

Mace : You are the worldo s best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.

Banker : I'm afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.

Mace : Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?

Banker : I don't have that gift.

Mace : It's not a gift, it's a skill, anyone can learn it. "So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown."�

Meryn : I thought that old shit would never stop singing.

Man : It wasn't bad, though.

Meryn : The Tyrells can all rot in hell, treasonous cunts. They were going to make that boy-fucker Renly king.

Meryn : This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos.

Man : You're buying?

Meryn : Oh, I'm buying. But I never was good at sharing.

Brothel Keeper : Sell your fish somewhere else.

Prostitute : Oh let her in, Brusco, I'm hungry. Come here, sweetness.

Prostitute : They say oyster's get the juices flowing. We'll take half a dozen.

Arya Stark : Three coppers.

Jon Snow : Here's a silver because the lady likes you.

Meryn : Too old.

Head Prostitute : Brea.

Head : I have just the one. Anara our most expensive girl, but well worth it, I assure you.

Meryn : Do you have what I want or not?

Head : Of course. Of course.

Man : Fresh? Come on, the lads are hungry.

Man : Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters.

Man : I'll have one.

Head : Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo!

Meryn : Good.

Meryn : I'll tell you when we're done.

Meryn : You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow.

Head : Of course.

Head : I'll have you whipped, girl! Go on!

Man : Valaar morghulis.

Jaqen Hghar : And?

Arya Stark : The Thin Man wasn't hungry today.

Jaqen Hghar : Perhaps that's why the man is thin.

Arya Stark : Tomorrow.

Jaqen Hghar : Tomorrow.

Jaqen Hghar : A girl has work to do.

Doran : Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die.

Doran : I believe in second chances. I don't believe in third chances.

Ellaria : You write like a 7 year old.

Jaime Lannister : Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.

Ellaria : He didn't try to make you pay?

Ellaria : Then maybe he's changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you'll be bringing her daughter home

Jaime Lannister : She will.

Ellaria : You love her very much, don't you?

Jaime Lannister : Of course, she's my niece.

Ellaria : I wasn't talking about her.

Ellaria : You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen. It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want.

Ellaria : I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.

Shireen : Father. Aren't you cold?

Stannis Baratheon : No. What are you reading?

Shireen : The Dance of Dragons.

Stannis Baratheon : What's it about?

Shireen : It's the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered.

Stannis Baratheon : The dance of dragons"�? Why is that a dance?

Shireen : That's just what they call it.

Stannis Baratheon : Doesn't make much sense.

Shireen : I think it's poetic.

Stannis Baratheon : If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?

Shireen : I wouldn't have chosen either. It's all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.

Stannis Baratheon : Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it.

Shireen : It's alright, father.

Stannis Baratheon : You don't even know what I'm talking about.

Shireen : It doesn't matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?

Stannis Baratheon : Yes there is.

Shireen : Good, I want to. I'm the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I'm your daughter.

Stannis Baratheon : Forgive me.

Shireen : Where's my father? I want to see my father.

Melisandre : It will all be over soon, Princess.

Shireen : Where's my father? No you can't do this, father where are you?!

Shireen : Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!

Selyse : It's what the Lord wants. It's a good thing. A great thing.

Melisandre : The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way.

Selyse : If we don't act then we'll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice.

Melisandre : Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!

Shireen : Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother!

Selyse : I can't.

Stannis Baratheon : There's no other way. She has King's blood.

Melisandre : Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!

Shireen : Mother, don't do this please! Please help! Don't do this! Please, father! Mother, help!

Selyse : No...

Daenerys Targaryen : Where have you been?

Hizdahr : Just making sure everything's in order.

Announcer : Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games!

Announcer : My queen, our first contest. Who will triumph

Quick : I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen.

Strong : I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen.

Hizdahr : They're waiting for you. Clap your hands.

Daario : That one, the smaller man, no question, that's where you should put your money.

Tyrion Lannister : The smaller man it is.

Daenerys Targaryen : I'm not putting my money anywhere.

Hizdahr : Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.

Daario : People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.

Hizdahr : I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not.

Daenerys Targaryen : Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?

Daario : Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn't get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here . And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren't. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy.

Hizdahr : You don't approve?

Tyrion Lannister : There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.

Hizdahr : Fair enough, yet -- it's an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?

Tyrion Lannister : It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.

Hizdahr : I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.

Daenerys Targaryen : That is greatness?

Hizdahr : That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.

Tyrion Lannister : My father would have liked you.

Announcer : We ask again

Daenerys Targaryen : One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.

Hizdahr : At your command?

Daenerys Targaryen : If need be.

Announcer : A Meereenese champion?

Hizdahr : How many people will die to make this happen?

Daenerys Targaryen : If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.

Hizdahr : Those men think they're dying for a good reason.

Daenerys Targaryen : Someone else's reason.

Hizdahr : So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don't know their own minds, but you do.

Tyrion Lannister : Well said, you're an eloquent man. Doesn't mean you're wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles.

Announcer : or a Westerosi Knight?!

Jorah Mormont : I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen.

Hizdahr : Your Grace--

Daario : Shut your mouth.

Tyrion Lannister : You can end this.

Hizdahr : She cannot.

Tyrion Lannister : You can!

Daario : Protect your queen!

Hizdahr : Your Grace, Your Grace, come with me! I know a way out! I know a way--

Tyrion Lannister : Stay close!

Jorah Mormont : This way!

Daario : The other side, follow me!

Daenerys Targaryen : Drogon!

Daenerys Targaryen : Valahd..

End : EPISODE

Melisandre : The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king. His fires have melted the snows away. The way ahead is clear.

Stannis Baratheon : We ride for Winterfell.

Melisandre : And you will take it. The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning. You will receive what is yours by right.

Soldier : Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : Prepare to form up.

Stannis Baratheon : Tell me.

Soldier : The men. Many deserted before dawn.

Stannis Baratheon : How many?

Soldier : Nearly half. All the sell-swords, with all the horses.

Soldier : Your Grace?

Stannis Baratheon : Speak up. It can't be worse than mutiny.

Stannis Baratheon : Cut her down.

Soldier : Your Grace. The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.

Stannis Baratheon : Get the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell.

Jon Snow : He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world.

Sam : So what are you gonna do?

Jon Snow : I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the wall.

Sam : But. the Dragonglass?

Jon Snow : No one's ever getting that back, now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it.

Sam : But. you killed a White Walker.

Jon Snow : With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw.

Sam : He's made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

Jon Snow : Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?

Sam : You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn't winning any elections back then.

Jon Snow : Here's to us then. Long may they sneer.

Jon Snow : What?

Sam : I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That's what I'm meant to be, not this.

Jon Snow : I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?

Sam : Well, there's Edd.

Sam : I'll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon's gone. The Citadel has the worldo s greatest library. I'll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come.

Sam : If Gilly stays here then she'll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. I'd rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that.

Sam : Thank you.

Jon Snow : You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too.

Sam : They'll bloody try.

Jon Snow : Sam?

Sam : What?

Jon Snow : Sam.

Jon Snow : You've just been beaten half to death. How did you--

Sam : Very carefully.

Jon Snow : I'm glad the end of the worldo s working out for someone.

Sam : I'll come back.

Jon Snow : To your return.

Sam : To my return.

Podrick : My lady! Stannis. Stannis Baratheon is coming. His whole army.

Brienne : How do you know it's Stannis?

Podrick : He's carrying his flaming heart banners. From the Blackwater. I'll never forget it.

Stannis Baratheon : Trench here. Another one 300 yards from the castle wall. Hurry them along. And send out a foraging party immediately. The siege begins at sunrise.

Soldier : There's not going to be a siege, Your Grace.

Stannis Baratheon : Bolton has women fighting for him.

Brienne : I do not fight for the Boltons. I'm Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?

Stannis Baratheon : I did.

Brienne : In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?

Stannis Baratheon : Go on, do your duty.

Ramsay Bolton : Looks like we're done here.

Survivor : I surrender. I surrender!

Ramsay Bolton : And I accept your surrender.

Ramsay Bolton : Let's head back. My wife must be lonely.

Myranda : My lady. I have come to escort you back to your chamber.

Theon Greyjoy : Go with her. Please.

Sansa Stark : I know what Ramsay is. I know what he'll do to me. If I'm going to die, let it happen while there's some of me left.

Myranda : Die? Who said anything about dying? You can't die yet. Your father was Warden of the North, and Ramsay needs you. Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you. Just the parts he'll use to make his heir. Until you've given him a boy or two and he's finished using them. He's got incredible plans for those parts. So. Shall we wait for him to come back, or shall we begin now?

Myranda : You're leaving it to me? Good. Let's begin.

Myranda : Stop! Stop!

Man : Open the gates!

Theon Greyjoy : He's coming back.

Meryn : I can see I have my work cut out for me.You two. Out.

Arya Stark : You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I've gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I'm glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?

Arya Stark : I can't hear you.

Arya Stark : You know who I am. I'm Arya Stark.

Arya Stark : Do you know who you are?

Arya Stark : You're no one. You're nothing.

Jaqen Hghar : A girl has taken a life. The wrong life.

Waif : I was right about her.

Jaqen Hghar : You were.

Waif : You're not ready. Not at all.

Jaqen Hghar : That man's life wasn't yours to take. A girl stole from the Many Faced God. Now a debt is owed.

Jaqen Hghar : Only death can pay for life.

Arya Stark : No! No! No, you don't die! Don't die!

Waif : Why are you crying?

Arya Stark : He was my friend.

Waif : No he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?

Jaqen Hghar : He was no one.

Arya Stark : But if you're. Who's this?

Jaqen Hghar : No one at all. Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.

Jaqen Hghar : The faces are for no one.

Jaqen Hghar : You are still someone.

Jaqen Hghar : And to someone.

Jaqen Hghar : the faces are as good as poison.

Arya Stark : I can't see!

Arya Stark : What's happening?! What's happening?!

Doran : I wish you a safe journey home.

Jaime Lannister : Thank you.

Ellaria : Forgive me child. I wish you all the happiness in the world.

Bronn : Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.

Tyene : Maybe I'll come visit you.

Bronn : Don't wait too long. I've a noble woman to marry back home.

Tyene : You want a good girl, but you need the bad pussy.

Jaime Lannister : Whenever you're ready, My Lord.

Jaime Lannister : Try not to lose it this time.

Myrcella : I'll never take it off again.

Jaime Lannister : I know you didn't want to leave Dorne. But I'm glad you're coming home. Your mother's desperate to see you. And I'm glad Trystane's coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You're lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so. so well arranged.

Myrcella : Do you think mother will like him.

Jaime Lannister : If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will.

Myrcella : And you really believe that?

Jaime Lannister : Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?

Myrcella : She likes you.

Jaime Lannister : I'm not so sure about that. Listen. There's something I've wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you've seen more of the world, you've learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you've fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? My point is. we don't choose whom we love. We just. It's beyond our control. I sound like an idiot.

Myrcella : No you don't.

Jaime Lannister : What I'm trying to say. What I'm trying and failing to say.

Myrcella : I know what you're trying to say.

Jaime Lannister : No. I'm afraid you don't.

Myrcella : I do.

Myrcella : I know. About you and mother. I think a part of me always knew. And I'm glad. I'm glad that you're my father.

Jaime Lannister : Myrcella?

Jaime Lannister : Myrcella?!

Jaime Lannister : Myrcella?! Myrcella?!

Tyrion Lannister : You love her, don't you? How could you not. Of course, it's hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman.

Daario : Does he always talk so much?

Grey Worm : Jorah the Andal.

Jorah Mormont : Torgo Nudho.

Grey Worm : You should not be here.

Daario : No, but he is.

Grey Worm : Our queen ordered him exiled from city.

Daario : Our queen would be dead if not for him.

Missandei : It's true. And I would be dead if not for the. little man.

Tyrion Lannister : Dwarf. I believe that's the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit "nostril"�.

Missandei : A bit "rusty"�.

Tyrion Lannister : Rusty"� Thank you.

Grey Worm : I am sorry. Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen.

Daario : You missed a good scrap.

Jorah Mormont : None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.

Tyrion Lannister : He's right. The dragon headed north. If we're going to find her, that's where we're to go.

Jorah Mormont : We? You're a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.

Tyrion Lannister : And I intend to help her do it.

Jorah Mormont : You've been here for how many days now? I've fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.

Tyrion Lannister : You betrayed her!

Jorah Mormont : Careful now.

Tyrion Lannister : And she exiled you, twice, I believe?

Jorah Mormont : The second time thanks to you.

Tyrion Lannister : Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.

Daario : He's right. The Queen exiled Jorah. And he's right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we'll know is if we ask her.

Tyrion Lannister : Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.

Jorah Mormont : If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.

Daario : Forgive me, but why would we bring you?

Tyrion Lannister : Pardon me?

Daario : Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?

Tyrion Lannister : Not precisely, but I have other skills that'd be very useful--

Daario : Can you fight?

Tyrion Lannister : I have fought. I don't claim to be a great warrior.

Daario : Are you good on a horse?

Tyrion Lannister : Middling.

Daario : So mainly you talk?

Tyrion Lannister : And drink. I've survived so far.

Daario : Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen.

Jorah Mormont : He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?

Daario : They wouldn't. They will listen to Grey Worm.

Grey Worm : I'll come with you. I'll find our queen.

Missandei : You are not strong enough to go anywhere.

Grey Worm : I am.

Daario : He is, he's the toughest man with no balls I've ever met. But you still can't go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen.

Missandei : It's true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half.

Daario : And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen's closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. Try not to ruin her. Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let's find some good horses. We have so much to talk about.

Voice : Hello, old friend.

Varys : I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.

Tyrion Lannister : I suppose there's no point in asking how you found me.

Varys : The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you've already found favor with the Mother of Dragons.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, she didn't execute me, so that's a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I'm stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?

Varys : Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies' strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.

Tyrion Lannister : If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.

Varys : If only. A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?

Tyrion Lannister : I did miss you.

Varys : Oh, I know.

Daenerys Targaryen : We have to go home.

Daenerys Targaryen : My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?

Daenerys Targaryen : How far did you carry me?

Daenerys Targaryen : Drogon, we need to return. My people need me.

Daenerys Targaryen : Well, there's no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper.

Septa : Confess. Confess.

Cersei Lannister : I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--

Sparrow : You wish to make a confession?

Cersei Lannister : Once I've confessed, will I be free?

Sparrow : Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.

Cersei Lannister : The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess.

Sparrow : Name him.

Cersei Lannister : Lancel Lannister.

Sparrow : Your cousin. And the King's squire.

Cersei Lannister : I was lonely and afraid.

Sparrow : You had a husband.

Cersei Lannister : A husband of whoring every chance he got.

Sparrow : His sins do not pardon your own.

Cersei Lannister : May the gods forgive me.

Sparrow : Other men?

Cersei Lannister : No.

Sparrow : No others?

Sparrow : Speaking falsehoods before the Gods is a great crime. You understand this?

Cersei Lannister : I do.

Sparrow : There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.

Cersei Lannister : A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother's children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers'. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it.

Sparrow : Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence.

Cersei Lannister : Trial? I have confessed?

Sparrow : To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.

Cersei Lannister : I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother's mercy. I haven't seen my son. I don't know how long it's been. I need to see him. Please.

Sparrow : You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness. In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.

Cersei Lannister : Thank you. Thank you.

Sparrow : The Mother is merciful. It is her you should thank.

Cersei Lannister : I will, I will. I swear it, day and night.

Sparrow : Good.

Cersei Lannister : Am I free to go?

Sparrow : After your atonement.

Cersei Lannister : My atonement?

Sparrow : A sinner comes before you. Cersei of House Lannister, mother to his Grace King Tommen, widow to his Grace King Robert. She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication. She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness. To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her, to you. The good people of the city. She comes before you with a solemn heart. Shorn of secrets. Naked before the eyes of gods and men. To make her walk of atonement.

Septa : Shame. Shame. Shame.

Crowd : Bitch! Whore! All hail her royal tits!

Woman : I've had half as many cocks as the queen!

Man : Suck me off! Suck me off, you bitch!

Qyburn : Your Grace. It's good to have you back. Come. We'll take you inside. I need to have a look at those feet.

Qyburn : May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the Kingsguard.

Qyburn : If it please Your Grace, he's taken a holy vow of silence. He has sworn that he will not speak until all his Grace's enemies are dead, and the evil has been driven from the realm.

Davos : He came to your aid. Stannis. Now he needs you!

Jon Snow : We don't have enough men to make any difference.

Davos : The wildlings will make a difference!

Jon Snow : The wildlings won't ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--

Davos : You saved their bloody lives. If they're going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place.

Jon Snow : It's not their fight!

Jon Snow : Stannis?

Davos : Shireen? The princess?

Olly : Lord Commander. It's one of the wildlings you brought back. Says he knows your Uncle Benjen. Says he's still alive.

Jon Snow : Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?

Olly : Says he was first Ranger. Said he knows where to find him.

Alliser : Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome the last full moon.

Jon Snow : He could be lying.

Alliser : Could be. There are ways to find out.

Jon Snow : Where is he?

Alliser : Over there.

Alliser : For the Watch.

Brother : For the Watch.

Jon Snow : Olly.

Olly : For the Watch.

End : EPISODE

End : SEASON

Nights Watchman : It's the Lord Commander!

Davos : Help me get him inside

Dolorous Edd : Thorne did this

Davos : How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?

Dolorous Edd : Trust? The men in this room

Davos : Does the wolf know you?

Davos : We need all the help we can get

Melisandre : Ser Davos

Melisandre : I saw him in the flames, fighting at Winterfell

Davos : I can't speak for the flames, but he's gone

Male Voice : He was our Lord Commander!

Male Voice : He never should have been!

Alliser Thorne : You all know why you're here Jon Snow is dead

Nights Watchman : Who killed him?

Alliser Thorne : I did

Alliser Thorne : And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck and the other officers in this castle

Nights Watchmen : Murderers!

Nights Watchman : Traitors!

Alliser Thorne : You're right!

Alliser Thorne : We've committed treason, all of us Jon Snow was my Lord Commander I had no love for him That was no secret But I never once disobeyed an order Loyalty is the foundation on which the Night's Watch is built, and the Watch means everything to me I have given my life, we have all given our lives to the Night's Watch Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night's Watch He let the wildlings through our gates, as no Lord Commander has ever done before He gave them the very land on which they reaved and raped and murdered Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right, I've no doubt about that And what he thought was right would have been the end of us He thrust a terrible choice upon us, and we made it

Davos : He'll have seen we didn't come Thorne will have made it official by now Castle Black is his

Dolorous Edd : I don't care who's sitting at the high table Jon was my friend, and those fuckers butchered him Now we return the favor

Davos : We don't have the numbers

Dolorous Edd : We have a direwolf

Davos : It's not enough I didn't know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn't have wanted his friends to die for nothing

Dolorous Edd : If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room We all die today I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go

Davos : We need to fight, but we don't need to die Not if we have help

Nights Watchman : Who's gonna help us?

Davos : You're not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow

Dolorous Edd : Bolt the door Don't let anyone in I'll be back as soon as I can

Ramsay Bolton : She was 11 the first time I saw her

Ramsay Bolton : The kennelmaster's daughter She smelled of dog I wasn't much older, but everybody was already afraid of me You certainly were

Ramsay Bolton : Myranda wasn't, though What could I do to her that those hounds couldn't? She was fearless There was nothing she wouldn't do.

Ramsay Bolton : Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over. I wish you could be here to watch.

Maester Wolkan : Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord? Or would you rather the men build a pyre?

Ramsay Bolton : Buried, burned?

Ramsay Bolton : This is good meat Feed it to the hounds

Roose : Your command of the cavalry was impressive Thanks to you, the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead Do you know who struck the killing blow?

Ramsay Bolton : No

Roose : A shame I'd reward the man Still, a great victory. Do you feel like a victor?

Roose : I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?

Roose : A reckoning will come We need the North to face it The entire North They won't back us without Sansa Stark We no longer have Sansa Stark You played your games with her You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they're both gone

Ramsay Bolton : I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds They won't get far

Roose : I'm glad to hear it Without Sansa, you won't be able to produce an heir. And without an heir, well.

Roose : let's hope the maesters are right and Lady Walder's carrying a boy

Theon Greyjoy : We can't stop

Theon Greyjoy : We have to cross here

Sansa Stark : I can't

Theon Greyjoy : It's the only way to throw off the hounds

Sansa Stark : But it's too cold I can't I won't make it I'll die

Theon Greyjoy : I've seen what his hounds do to a person This way is better

Theon Greyjoy : Over here Come on

Theon Greyjoy : Sansa Sansa

Theon Greyjoy : Stay here. I'll lure them away

Sansa Stark : No, I won't make it without you

Theon Greyjoy : You will Go north, only north Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black He'll help you

Bolton Officer : Where is Lady Bolton?

Theon Greyjoy : Dead

Bolton Officer : Liar

Theon Greyjoy : She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts I left her to die in the snow

Bolton Officer : I can't wait to see what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time

Brienne : Lady Sansa, I offer my services once again I will shield your back and keep your council and give my life for yours if need be I swear it by the old gods and the new

Sansa Stark : And I vow...that you shall always have a place by my hearth and.

Podrick : Meat and mead at my table

Sansa Stark : Meat and mead at my table And I pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor I swear it by the old gods and the new Arise

Handmaiden : Your Grace, I'm sorry to disturb you A ship from Dorne has sailed into the harbor

Cersei Lannister : Myrcella.

Cersei Lannister : Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?

Jaime Lannister : Mother

Cersei Lannister : All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now? Has she started to bloat? Has her skin turned black? Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?

Cersei Lannister : I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt

Cersei Lannister : I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse

Jaime Lannister : Shh, shh Don't think about it

Cersei Lannister : I have to I have to It's not right she has to suffer alone

Jaime Lannister : She's not suffering She's gone No one can hurt her anymore

Cersei Lannister : She was good From her first breath, she was so sweet I don't know where she came from She was nothing like me No meanness, no jealous, just good

Jaime Lannister : I know

Cersei Lannister : I thought if I could make something so good, so pure...maybe I'm not a monster

Jaime Lannister : Listen -- listen to me She was my daughter and I failed her

Cersei Lannister : No, I knew this would happen The witch told me years ago She promised me three children She promised me they'd die "And gold their shrouds"� Everything she said came true You couldn't have stopped it It's prophecy It's fate

Jaime Lannister : You don't believe that

Cersei Lannister : Of course I do You told me yourself when Father died You said we had to stay together You said people would try to tear us apart, take what's ours That was a prophecy, too I didn't listen to you, and everything you said came true

Septa Unella : The Seven Hells brim with the souls of saintly men They scream in agony and their shame is so great, they do not feel the flames, for now they see if not for a single sin they concealed, they were saved"�

Margaery Tyrell : I'd like to see my brother

Septa Unella : Confess

Margaery Tyrell : Please How is he? At least tell me that

Margaery Tyrell : I am the queen and I demand to see my brother

Septa Unella : Sinners don't make commands They make confessions

Sparrow : Septa Unella

Sparrow : Our other guests need you

Sparrow : There

Sparrow : Septa Unella can be overzealous at times I'll speak with her

Margaery Tyrell : My brother, can you tell me how he is?

Sparrow : It isn't Ser Loras that brings me here Your husband misses you dearly The love between a man and wife is sacred It reflects the love the gods have for all of us But sin leads us away from the sacred And only confession can purge sin

Margaery Tyrell : I have nothing to confess

Sparrow : So you believe you are pure? Perfect? Wholly without sin?

Margaery Tyrell : None of us are

Sparrow : You have started down the path But you have many miles to go.

Doran : I always envied Oberyn He lived He truly lived Sailed around the world Fought men from every country Lay with the most beautiful women alive

Ellaria : And men

Doran : And men He experienced everything, while I sat here in Dorne trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed But that is life We each have our roles

Doran : Oberyn was born to be an adventurer And I was born to rule

Ellaria : The gods are not fools You would have been a lousy adventurer And Oberyn, pfft, he would have been a terrible ruler

Doran : Your mother is a brilliant woman, you know that?

Maester : Prince Doran.

Doran : The Princess Myrcella.

Ellaria : When was the last time you left this palace? You don't know your own people Their disgust for you Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing Oberyn martell butchered, and you did nothing You're not a Dornishman You're not our prince

Doran : My son Trystane.

Ellaria : Your son is weak just like you And weak men will never rule Dorne again.

Trystane : I told you I'm not hungry

Obara : We're not here to feed you

Obara : We're here to kill you

Nymeria : You want her to do it or me?

Trystane : We are family I don't want to hurt you

Nymeria : Her or me?

Nymeria : Good.

Obara : Smart boy.

Nymeria : You're a greedy bitch, you know that?

Tyrion Lannister : We're never going to fix what's wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid

Tyrion Lannister : We'll be fine We're dressed like common merchants

Varys : You walk like a rich person

Tyrion Lannister : You've spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?

Varys : You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy

Tyrion Lannister : It's a good thing you're not a boy anymore...because you have no cock

Tyrion Lannister : For your baby To eat

Varys : She thinks you want to eat her baby

Varys : His Valyrian is terrible He only wants to give you money, so your baby can eat

Varys : Mhysa means mother in Valyrian

Tyrion Lannister : I know what mhysa means

Varys : Who wrote it?

Tyrion Lannister : Hard to know Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be

Varys : The Sons of the Harpy?

Tyrion Lannister : Very possibly Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren't even property to begin with You can see why they're unhappy Of course, it could also be the freed men

Listeners : For the night is dark and full of terrors.

Red Priest : The Lord of Light sent the Mother of Dragons to you, and those who love the darkness chased her away

Tyrion Lannister : Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them

Varys : She did fly away on a dragon and not come back

Red Priest : How will you respond? Will you wring your hands, while you wait for the Mother of Dragons to return? Or will you you take up her flames yourselves? Will you fight for your own salvation, now that Queen Daenerys is not here to fight for you?

Tyrion Lannister : It's a problem

Tyrion Lannister : Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you We can't fight an enemy we don't know

Varys : The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully, which means they take orders from someone

Tyrion Lannister : And have you started looking for that someone?

Varys : My little birds have already taken wing Soon they'll return, singing songs of men in gold masks

Tyrion Lannister : Well, we won't be sailing to Westeros anytime soon

Daario : Goat?

Jorah Mormont : Ram

Daario : You think our friend got him?

Jorah Mormont : Don't know anything else that can melt a ram's horn

Daario : We're on the right path, then

Daario : Perhaps she's tired of being queen I don't think she likes it very much

Jorah Mormont : She's too smart to like it

Daario : Maybe she's flown somewhere else, somewhere far away from men like us

Jorah Mormont : I've been all over the world There's no escaping men like us

Daario : There's no escaping her, eh? You keep coming back Why?

Jorah Mormont : You know why

Daario : isn't it frustrating wanting someone who doesn't want you back?

Jorah Mormont : Of course it is

Daario : You're a romantic I admire that Sometimes I look at you and I think, "So that's what I'll be like when I grow old"�

Jorah Mormont : If you grow old

Daario : If I grow old I hope I do I want to see what the world looks like when she's done conquering it

Jorah Mormont : So do I

Daario : Huh, an army?

Jorah Mormont : Not an army A horde

Daario : Dothraki?

Jorah Mormont : They have her

Bloodrider : Maybe she saw a ghost My friendo s mother saw a ghost and her hair turned white

Bloodrider : Pink people are afraid of the sun It burns their skin This one stands too long in the sun and her hair goes white

Bloodrider : You think she's got white pussy hair too? You ever been with a girl with white pussy hair?

Bloodrider : Only when I was fucking your grandma

Bloodrider : I'll ask Khal Moro for a night with you What do you think?

Bloodrider : Pretty eyes, but she's an idiot

Bloodrider : She doesn't have to be smart to get fucked in the ass

Bloodrider : I like to talk when I'm finished Otherwise, we might as well be dogs

Bloodrider : For you, my Khal The white-haired girl we found in the hills

Bloodrider : Look at those lips, blood of my blood

Wife : Blue-eyed women are witches

Wife : It is known

Wife : Cut off her head, before she casts a spell on you

Khal Moro : Even if I was blind, I'd hear my wives say, "Cut off her head"� and I'd know this woman was beautiful I'm glad I'm not blind Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time, what is better than that?

Bloodrider : Killing another Khal?

Khal Moro : Yes, killing another Khal

Bloodrider : Conquering a city and taking her people as slaves, and taking her idols back to Vaes Dothrak.

Bloodrider : Breaking a wild horse, forcing it to submit to your will

Khal Moro : Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time is among the five best things in life

Daenerys Targaryen : Do not touch me

Daenerys Targaryen : I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar of the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons

Khal Moro : You are nobody, the millionth of your name, Queen of Nothing, slave of Khal Moro Tonight I will lie with you, and if the Great Stallion is kind, you will give me a son Do you understand?

Daenerys Targaryen : I will not lie with you And I will bear no children, for you, or anyone else Not until the sun rises in the west, and sets in the east.

Wife : I told you she was a witch Cut off her head

Khal Moro : I like her She has spirit

Daenerys Targaryen : I was wife of Khal Drogo, son of Khal Bharbo

Khal Moro : Khal Drogo is dead

Daenerys Targaryen : I know I burnt his body

Khal Moro : Forgive me I did not know It is forbidden to lie with a Khal's widow No one will touch you You have my word

Daenerys Targaryen : If you will escort me back to Meereen, I will see that your khalasar is given a thousand horses, as a sign of my gratitude

Khal Moro : When a Khal dies, there is only one place for his Khaleesi

Wife : Vaes Dothrak The Temple of the Dosh Khaleen

Wife : To live out her days with the widows of dead Khals It is known

Arya Stark : Thank you

Waif : Are you listening, blind girl? Do you hear them talking? Do any of them talk to you? No So sad

Waif : Stand and fight, blind girl

Arya Stark : I can't see

Waif : That's your problem, not mine

Waif : See you tomorrow.

Alliser Thorne : Ser Davos, we have no cause to fight We are both anointed knights

Davos : Hear that, lads? Nothing to fear

Alliser Thorne : I will grant amnesty to all brothers who thrown down their arms before nightfall And you, Ser Davos, I will allow you to travel south, a free man with a fresh horse

Davos : And some mutton I'd like some mutton

Alliser Thorne : What?

Davos : I'm not much of a hunter I'll need some food if I'm gonna make it south without starving

Alliser Thorne : We'll give you food You can bring the Red Woman with you if you like Or you can leave her here with us, whichever you choose But surrender by nightfall or this ends with blood

Davos : Thank you, Ser Alliser We'll discuss amongst ourselves and come back to you with an answer

Davos : Boys, I've been running from men like that ll my life In my learned opinion, we open that door --

Nights Watchman : And they'll slaughter us all

Nights Watchman : They want to come in, they're gonna come in

Davos : Aye, but we don't need to make it easy for them

Nights Watchman : Edd is our only chance

Nights Watchman : It's a sad fucking statement if Dolorous Edd is our only chance

Davos : There's always the Red Woman

Nights Watchman : What's one redhead gonna do against 40 armed men?

Davos : You haven't seen her do what I've seen her do

Young Rodrik : Give him another go, Ned

Bran Stark : That's my father. And my Uncle Benjen

Young Ned : Keep your shield up or I'll ring your head like a bell

Bran Stark : They were all so happy

Threeeyed Raven : So were you once

Young Ned : Stop showing off

Young Benjen : Lyanna!

Bran Stark : My Aunt Lyanna I've seen her statue in the crypt My father never talked about her

Young Benjen : Would you get out of here? We're sparring

Young Lyanna : Who are you gonna spar with when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

Young Benjen : I don't know

Young Lyanna : What about him?

Young Ned : Wylis, come here

Bran Stark : Hodor?

Young Benjen : But he's got giant's blood

Young Ned : And you've got training Sounds like a fair match to me

Young Lyanna : Benjen always lifts his chin when he's about to charge

Young Hodor : And lowers it when he's going to dodge, my lady

Bran Stark : Hodor talks?

Nan : You leave the fighting to the little lords, Wylis Come along, now It's no place for you

Young Ned : Oh, Nan, look at the size of him If he ever learned to fight, he'd be unstoppable

Nan : Well, he's never going to learn to fight because he's a stable boy. So leave him be

Threeeyed Raven : It is time to go

Bran Stark : Please, a little longer

Bran Stark : You finally show me something I care about and then you drag me away

Threeeyed Raven : It is beautiful beneath the sea, but if you stay too long, you'll drown

Bran Stark : I wasn't drowning I was home

Bran Stark : Wylis

Hodor : Hodor

Bran Stark : I saw you as a boy You could talk What happened?

Bran Stark : Where's Meera?

Bran Stark : You shouldn't be here It's not safe outside the cave

Meera : It's not safe anywhere

Bran Stark : I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor

Bran Stark : His real name is Wylis And he could talk and fight and -- and then --

Bran Stark : What's wrong?

Bran Stark : The Three-Eyed Raven says there's a war coming

Meera : And we're going to fight it in there

Child Of Forest : Brandon Stark needs you

Meera : For what? I sit in there and I watch him have his visions and nothing ever happens

Child Of Forest : He isn't going to stay there forever And out there he needs you

Alliser Thorne : It's time, Ser Davos Open the door and the men inside can rejoin their brothers in peace We'll even set the wolf free north of the Wall where it belongs Nobody needs to die tonight

Davos : I've never been much of a fighter

Davos : Apologies for what you're about to see

Alliser Thorne : Come on

Alliser Thorne : Attack!

Alliser Thorne : Fight, you cowards!

Alliser Thorne : You fucking traitor

Dolorous Edd : The only traitors here are the ones who shoved their knives into their Lord Commander's heart

Alliser Thorne : For thousands of years the Night's Watch has held Castle Black against the Wildlings

Tormund : Until you

Dolorous Edd : Throw them into the cells where they belong

Tormund : Took a lot of knives I'll have my men get the wood for a fire Bodies to burn

Storyteller : Right, so there she is, high and mighty Queen Cersei, tits and ass jiggling in the breeze

Storyteller : All of a sudden she looks my way Gives me a little smile like, "Well?"� So, all right, you know, I've never been shy and I'm blessed down south, so I put it right out She's never seen anything like it I mean, she's used to her brother, and from what I hear, Jaime Lannister's half an inch shy of an inch She sees it and I swear to the gods she licks her lips Well, you all know me You know I wouldn't lie about this

Cersei Lannister : Get out of my way

Kings Soldier : King's orders, Your Grace

Cersei Lannister : What are the king's orders?

Kings Soldier : He would like you to remain in the Red Keep, Your Grace, for your own protection

Cersei Lannister : You're barring me from attending my own daughter's funeral?

Kings Soldier : Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's command, I cannot let you pass

Cersei Lannister : I would like to speak to my son

Kings Soldier : He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace

Tommen Lannister : She grew up

Jaime Lannister : Almost

Tommen Lannister : Have we caught Prince Trystane's killers? I expect it was Mother

Jaime Lannister : Your mother wouldn't do that

Tommen Lannister : Yes, she would

Jaime Lannister : Are you angry with her?

Tommen Lannister : Of course not

Jaime Lannister : Then why didn't you let her come? She has every right to be here

Tommen Lannister : They told me she wouldn't be allowed in the sept If she had tried --

Jaime Lannister : They're not putting your mother in a cell ever again Not while I'm here Why haven't you gone to see her? Everything she endured, she did it for you

Tommen Lannister : Don't you think I know that? I'm sorry But I can't

Jaime Lannister : Why not?

Tommen Lannister : When the Faith Militant seized her and Margaery, what did I do? When they paraded her through the streets like a whore, what did I do?

Jaime Lannister : We all fail sometimes

Tommen Lannister : The king is supposed to be the Protector of the Realm If I can't even protect my own wife or my own mother, what good am I?

Jaime Lannister : Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you

Sparrow : Your Grace Lord Commander

Tommen Lannister : I want to see my wife

Sparrow : The gods wait for Queen Margaery to confess her crimes and seek their mercy The king must wait as well

Jaime Lannister : Go and see your mother, Tommen

Jaime Lannister : You're a bold man

Sparrow : On the contrary I fear a great deal The Father, the Mother, the Warrior

Sparrow : Do you know why we use these stones? To remind us not to fear death We close our eyes on this world and open them on the next

Jaime Lannister : You must long for the next life

Sparrow : In truth, I fear that, too

Jaime Lannister : You imprisoned and humiliated my sister

Sparrow : Your sister sought the gods' mercy and atoned for her sin

Jaime Lannister : What about my sins?

Jaime Lannister : I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back I killed my own cousin When the gods judged my brother guilty, I helped him escape their justice What atonement do I deserve?

Sparrow : You would spill blood in this holy place?

Jaime Lannister : Oh, the gods won't mind They've spilled more blood than the rest of us combined

Sparrow : Go on, then I deserve it We all do We are weak, vain creatures We live only by the Mother's mercy

Jaime Lannister : They should be closer if you mean for them to save you

Sparrow : I don't They'd never reach me before you struck

Jaime Lannister : I've fought against worse odds

Sparrow : No doubt many of us would fall But who are we, hmm? We have no names, no family Every one of us is poor and powerless And yet together, we can overthrow an empire

Tommen Lannister : Mother

Cersei Lannister : Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?

Tommen Lannister : Gold

Cersei Lannister : Good It was always her color

Tommen Lannister : I'm sorry for keeping you here I shouldn't have, but I was -- I didn't want to lose you again

Cersei Lannister : I understand I'm glad to see you

Tommen Lannister : I know I should have come sooner I wanted to I was wrong

Cersei Lannister : It's all right

Tommen Lannister : No, it isn't

Tommen Lannister : I should have executed all of them I should have pulled down the sept onto the High Sparrow's head before I let them do that to you, as you would have for me You raised me to be strong...and I wasn't But I want to be Help me

Cersei Lannister : Always

Tyrion Lannister : If I lost my cock, I'd drink all the time

Tyrion Lannister : Meaning no offense He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes

Varys : I do not make dwarf jokes

Tyrion Lannister : You think them

Varys : So, the fleet It's been burned

Grey Worm : We are searching for the men who burned the ships, but nobody saw anything

Tyrion Lannister : Surely there's some good news lurking somewhere

Varys : Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid

Tyrion Lannister : Perhaps they can tell us their secret

Varys : The Masters have retaken both cities Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's Bay has returned to the slavers

Tyrion Lannister : What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid

Missandei : They are not eating They haven't touched any food since Queen Daenerys left

Tyrion Lannister : Daenerys is the dragon queen Can't very well let the dragons starve, that's obvious

Grey Worm : If a dragon does not want to eat, how do you force him to eat?

Tyrion Lannister : Dragons do not do well in captivity

Missandei : How do you know this?

Tyrion Lannister : That's what I do I drink and I know things

Tyrion Lannister : The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles Then Daenerys's ancestors started chaining them up in pens A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats They must be unchained or they'll waste away Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons?

Missandei : Many times

Tyrion Lannister : And did they ever harm you?

Missandei : Never

Tyrion Lannister : Dragons are intelligent More intelligent than men according to some maesters They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies I am their friend

Varys : Do they know that?

Tyrion Lannister : They will It's time they had their supper

Tyrion Lannister : I'm friends with your mother I'm here to help Don't eat the help

Tyrion Lannister : When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day I begged him for one of you "It wouldn't even have to be a big dragon,"� I told him "It could be little, like me"�

Tyrion Lannister : Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago I cried myself to sleep that night

Tyrion Lannister : But here you are

Tyrion Lannister : Next time I have an idea like that, punch me in the face

Waif : What's your name?

Arya Stark : No one

Waif : I don't believe that

Waif : You don't believe that

Jaqen Hghar : Who are you?

Jaqen Hghar : If a girl says her name, a man will let her sleep under a roof tonight

Arya Stark : A girl has no name

Jaqen Hghar : If a girl says her name, a man will feed her tonight

Jaqen Hghar : If a girl says her name, a man will give her eyes back

Jaqen Hghar : Come

Jaqen Hghar : Leave it A girl is not a beggar anymore

Lord Karstark : He came upon the bodies on our way here

Roose : Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?

Ramsay Bolton : They obviously had help

Roose : I didn't think lady Sansa killed them all by herself Thank you for this report, Lord Kastark

Ramsay Bolton : We know where she's going Her brother's at Castle Black

Lord Karstark : Ned Stark's last surviving son?

Roose : Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark

Ramsay Bolton : So was I, Father

Lord Karstark : Your hold on the North will never be secure as long as a Stark can walk through that door

Ramsay Bolton : Castle Black isn't defended on the southern side And the few men left are barely men at all. Farm boys and thieves With a small force we could storm the castle, kill Jon Snow --

Roose : Murder the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch? You'd unite every house in the North against us

Ramsay Bolton : We don't need every house in the North. The Umbers, the Manderlys, and the Karstarks command more soldiers than all the other houses combined With their support, none could challenge us

Lord Karstark : The Starks lost my house the day King Rob cut off my father's head It's time for new blood in the North

Roose : If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog, you'll be treated as a mad dog Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed

Maester Wolkan : My lords Lady Walda has given birth A boy Red-cheeked and healthy

Lord Karstark : My congratulations, Lord Bolton

Ramsay Bolton : Congratulations, Father I look forward to meeting my new brother

Roose : You'll always be my firstborn

Ramsay Bolton : Thank you for saying that It means a great deal to me

Ramsay Bolton : Maester Wolkan, send ravens to all the Northern houses Roose Bolton is dead Poisoned by our enemies

Ramsay Bolton : How did he die

Maester Wolkan : Poisoned by his enemies

Lord Karstark : You're talking to your lord Use respect

Maester Wolkan : Forgive me, my lord

Ramsay Bolton : Send for Lady Walda and the baby

Maester Wolkan : She's resting, my lord

Maester Wolkan : At once, my lord

Ramsay Bolton : There he is

Lady Walda : Isn't he wonderful

Ramsay Bolton : May I hold him

Lady Walda : Of course

Ramsay Bolton : Little brother

Lady Walda : Lord Bolton sent for us Have you seen him?

Ramsay Bolton : Of course Follow me, Mother

Lady Walda : Where is Lord Bolton

Ramsay Bolton : Down

Lady Walda : It's all right. Come on, shh

Lady Walda : It's cold out here, Ramsay I need to feed him

Lady Walda : Ramsay, where is your father? Ramsay? Where is Lord Bolton?

Ramsay Bolton : I am Lord Bolton

Lady Walda : Ramsay Ramsay, please I'll leave Winterfell. I'll go back to the Riverlands Please. Ramsay He's your brother

Ramsay Bolton : I prefer being an only child

Brienne : I saw her with a man I don't think he hurt her She didn't want to leave him, he didn't want to leave her

Sansa Stark : You don't know which way she went?

Brienne : I spent three days looking for her She disappeared

Sansa Stark : How did she look

Brienne : She looked good She wasn't exactly dressed like a lady

Sansa Stark : No, she wouldn't be

Brienne : What happened at Winterfell

Sansa Stark : I shouldo ve gone with you while I had the chance

Brienne : It was a difficult choice, my lady

Brienne : We've all had to make difficult choices

Theon Greyjoy : We shouldn't be lighting fires It's not safe He won't stop hunting us

Sansa Stark : We just have to make it to Castle Black Once we're with Jon, Ramsay won't be able to touch us

Theon Greyjoy : Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate

Sansa Stark : I won't let him I'll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon

Theon Greyjoy : And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place The truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded

Theon Greyjoy : And the truth about Rob, who I betrayed

Sansa Stark : When you take the black, all your crimes are forgiven

Theon Greyjoy : I don't want to be forgiven I can never make amends to your family for all the things that I've done They'll keep you safer than I ever could

Sansa Stark : You're not coming with us?

Theon Greyjoy : I would have taken you all the way to the Wall I would have died to get you there

Theon Greyjoy : May I take one of the horses?

Sansa Stark : Where will you go?

Theon Greyjoy : Home

Yara Greyjoy : The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte

Balon : And the Ironborn who held it

Yara Greyjoy : They died fighting to a man

Balon : What is dead may never die

Yara Greyjoy : What is dead may never die

Yara Greyjoy : But they did and our invasion died with them Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland

Balon : They we will take more

Yara Greyjoy : Why? For more pinecones and rocks

Balon : Because I order it

Yara Greyjoy : We can defeat anyone at sea, but we'll never hold lands and castles against mainland armies

Balon : Not if our captains defy my orders, abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish mission

Yara Greyjoy : I won't apologize for trying to rescue Theon

Balon : Then where is he

Yara Greyjoy : Where is your kingdom We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war That war is over The last time we provoked them too far, I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers I lost two brothers that day

Balon : And I lost three sons The War of the Five Kings, they call it Well, the other four are dead When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you wan. But for now, shut your mouth and obey or I will make another heir who will

Balon : Let me pass. You fool, move aside for your king.

Hooded Figure : Haven't I always, brother?

Balon : I thought you'd be rotting under some foreign sea by now

Euron Greyjoy : What is dead may never die

Euron Greyjoy : Has the custom changed since I've been gone? Aren't you supposed to repeat the words?

Balon : You can mock our god without my help

Euron Greyjoy : I don't mock the Drowned God I am the Drowned God From Oldtown to Qarth, when men see my sails, they pray

Euron Greyjoy : You're old, brother You've had your time Now let another rule

Balon : I heard you lost your mind during the storm on the Jade Sea They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard

Euron Greyjoy : They did

Balon : And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues

Euron Greyjoy : I needed silence

Balon : What kind of an Ironborn loses his senses during a storm

Euron Greyjoy : I am the storm, brother The first storm and the last And you're in my way

Aeron : Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children

All : What is dead may never die

Yara Greyjoy : I'm going to find out who did this I'm going to feed them to the sharks while they live I swear it by the Salt Throne

Aeron : The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon, not unless the kingsmoot chooses you

Yara Greyjoy : My father wouldo ve wanted me to rule

Aeron : Your father does not get to choose The law is clear Perhaps you'll win Perhaps you'll be the first woman in history to rule the Ironborn And perhaps not

Melisandre : Come in

Davos : I'm sorry, my lady I didn't mean to interrupt

Melisandre : You interrupt nothing

Davos : I assume you know why I'm here

Melisandre : I will after you tell me

Davos : It's about the Lord Commander

Melisandre : The former Lord Commander

Davos : Does he have to be?

Melisandre : What are you asking

Davos : Do you know of any magicthat could help him? Bring him back?

Melisandre : If you want to help him, leave him be

Davos : Can it be done

Melisandre : There are some with his power

Davos : How

Melisandre : I don't know

Davos : Have you seen it done

Melisandre : I met a man who came back from the dead, but the priest who did it -- It shouldn't have been possible

Davos : But it was It could be now

Melisandre : Not for me

Davos : Not for you? I saw you drink poison that shouldo ve killed you I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows

Melisandre : Everything I believed, the great victory I saw in the flames, all of it was a lie

Melisandre : You were right all along The Lord never spoke to me

Davos : Fuck him, then Fuck all of them I'm not a devout man, obviously Seven Gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same

Davos : I'm not asking the Lord of Light for helpI'm asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist

Melisandre : I never had this gift

Davos : Have you ever tried?

Melisandre : Please

Davos : Easy, easy Easy

Davos : What do you remember?

Jon Snow : They stabbed me Olly...he put a knife in my heart I shouldn't be here

Davos : The lady brought you back.

Melisandre : Afterwards, after they stabbed you, after you died, where did you go? What did you see?

Jon Snow : Nothing There was nothing at all

Melisandre : The Lord let you come back for a reason Stannis was not the prince who was promised, but someone has to be

Davos : Could you give us a moment?

Davos : You were dead And now you're not That's completely fucking mad, seems to me I can only imagine how it seems to you

Jon Snow : I did what I thought was right And I got murdered for it And now I'm back Why?

Davos : I don't know Maybe we'll never know What does it matter? You go on You fight for as long as you can You clean up as much of the shit as you can

Jon Snow : I don't know how to do that I thought I did, but...I failed

Davos : Good Now go fail again

Tormund : They think you're some kind of god The man who returned from the dead

Jon Snow : I'm not a god

Tormund : I know that

Tormund : I saw your pecker What kind of god would have a pecker that small?

Dolorous Edd : Your eyes are still brown Is that still you in there?

Jon Snow : I think so Hold off on burning my body for now

Dolorous Edd : That's funny You sure that's still you in there?

Gilly : You all right?

Sam Tarly : Yes Yes, I'm fine

Gilly : Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?

Sam Tarly : I don't think so

Gilly : Sea, see They're spelled different, but they sound the same

Sam Tarly : Yeah, they do

Gilly : It was before I learned how to read, obviously

Gilly : Sam, are you going to be sick?

Gilly : Won't be long We'll be in the south soon I'm excited to see Oldtown Captain says it's the most beautiful city in Westeros Are you going to vomit again?

Sam Tarly : No No, no, no The Citadel doesn't admit women There won't be a place for you there or for Little Sam

Gilly : I stayed at Castle Black There's no women allowed there

Sam Tarly : The Citadel isn't Castle Black I don't have a Jon Snow or a Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules

Gilly : I'll stay in Oldtown, then

Sam Tarly : By yourself? With a baby and no money?

Gilly : So if we're not going to Oldtown, where are you taking me?

Sam Tarly : To my home Horn Hill My father's -- well, my father, but my mother's a kind woman and my sister's lovely They'll take care of you both

Gilly : Wherever you go, I go, too"� That's what you said

Sam Tarly : I said that because I want you and Little Same to be safe That's all I want -- to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes so you'll be safe

Gilly : Us and everyone else in the world

Sam Tarly : I don't care about them Well, no, I do, but I don't really I care about you and him

Gilly : I know that, Sam And he does, too You're the only one who ever has

Gilly : If you think it's for the best, we trust you

Sam Tarly : I'd feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off

Gilly : I'd never do that to the father of my son

Bran Stark : That's my father

Threeeyed Raven : The man beside him is Howland Reed, Meera's father.

Bran Stark : Ser Arthur Dayne

Threeeyed Raven : The Sword of the Morning

Bran Stark : Father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw

Arthur : Lord Stark

Eddard Stark : I looked for you on the Trident

Arthur : We weren't there

Kingsguard : Your friend the usurper would lie beneath the ground if we had been

Eddard Stark : The Mad King is dead Rhaegar lies beneath the ground Why weren't you there to protect your prince?

Arthur : Our prince wanted us here

Eddard Stark : Where's my sister?

Arthur : I wish you good fortune in the wars to come

Arthur : And now it begins

Eddard Stark : No Now it ends

Bran Stark : He's better than my father

Threeeyed Raven : Far better

Bran Stark : But Father beat him

Threeeyed Raven : Did he?

Bran Stark : I know he did Heard the story a thousand times

Bran Stark : He stabbed him in the back

Bran Stark : What's in the tower?

Threeeyed Raven : That's enough for one day We'll visit again another time

Bran Stark : I want to see where he's going

Threeeyed Raven : Time to go

Bran Stark : Father!

Bran Stark : Why did you do that? Take me back there I want to go back

Threeeyed Raven : No

Bran Stark : He heard me

Threeeyed Raven : Maybe Maybe he heard the wind

Threeeyed Raven : The past is already written The ink is dry

Bran Stark : What's in that tower? I want to go back there

Threeeyed Raven : I've told you many times, stay too long where you don't belong and you will never return

Bran Stark : Why do I want to return? So I can be a cripple again? So I can talk to an old man in a tree?

Threeeyed Raven : You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me?

Bran Stark : So why did you?

Threeeyed Raven : I was waiting for you

Bran Stark : I don't want to be you

Threeeyed Raven : I don't blame you You won't be here forever You won't be an old man in a tree But before you leave, you must learn

Bran Stark : Learn what?

Threeeyed Raven : Everything

Bloodrider : Hey, Great Khaleesi Move your ass

Khal Moro : Welcome home, Khaleesi

Dothraki Woman : Go

Daenerys Targaryen : What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads!

Daenerys Targaryen : You have made a mistake One you will regret I am the wife of the Great Khal

Dothraki Matron : We know who you are I remember you eating the stallion's heart Why didn't you come to us after Khal Drogo died?

Daenerys Targaryen : Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons My place is not here with you

Dothraki Matron : You were the wife of the Great Khal You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side He didn't I was the wife of the Great Khal Khal Savo I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side You're young We were all young once But we all understand the way things are You will learn as well, if you are fortunate enough to stay with us

Daenerys Targaryen : Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen

Dothraki Matron : Yes Immediately after the death of their khal But you went out into the world That is forbidden All the khalasars have returned for the Khalar Vezhven They will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogo's silver-haired widow With luck, your place will be here with us, Mother of Dragons It is the best you can hope for, now

Varys : I don't know how you stand it in all that leather

Varys : If we could have the room

Varys : You look lovely today, my dear You really do How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat

Woman : If you're going to torture me, just call them back and get on with it

Varys : I am not a torturer

Varys : Though it so often is what people deserve

Varys : And it does provide answers But they're usually the wrong answers My job is to find the right answers Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy I'd like to make you happy, Vala That's your name, isn't it, Vala?

Varys : That's all right I know who you are and what you've done You've done a lot You've sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons

Vala : The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history

Varys : I understand Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective I have a different perspective, of course I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? I'm afraid I don't really speak the language Such a handsome boy Those big, brown eyes Good luck keeping the ladies away

Vala : Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you? You won't torture me, you'll just threaten my son

Varys : Children are blameless I have never hurt them Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers We both know the penalty for that crime How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem

Vala : If I tell you anything, they'll kill me So either you kill me or they do

Varys : Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem There is a third option, though A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos I've already booked passage for a woman and her young son I'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again

Varys : Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it Far too heavy for me The boat sails at dawn You need to decide now A new life for you and Dom or.

Tyrion Lannister : What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?

Tyrion Lannister : You speak 19 languages You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things

Tyrion Lannister : You two, you spend a great deal of time together What would you be talking about if I weren't here?

Grey Worm : Patrol When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied What we see on patrol Who we captured on patrol

Tyrion Lannister : That's good That's very good

Tyrion Lannister : But that's a report I was thinking more of a conversation A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms

Missandei : Who said this?

Tyrion Lannister : Me Just now All right, no conversations Let's play a game

Tyrion Lannister : You don't play games, either one of you, ever?

Grey Worm : Games are for children

Missandei : My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games

Tyrion Lannister : There, that's a start

Missandei : Only the girls

Tyrion Lannister : Oh no, no, no Not that, of course not that Innocent games, fun games, drinking games

Missandei : We do not drink

Tyrion Lannister : Until you do

Tyrion Lannister : Alright No drinking We can play without drinking It's a wonderful game I invented it Here's how it works I make a statement about your past If I'm wrong, I drink And if I'm right -- Maybe we can't play without drinking

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, you took your time

Varys : Sorry I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy Some things you can't rush

Missandei : You found out?

Varys : The good masters of Astapor And the wise masters of Yunkai With help from their friends in Volantis

Tyrion Lannister : You see? You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it

Grey Worm : We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once We will do it again and execute the Masters

Tyrion Lannister : If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?

Grey Worm : If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?

Missandei : We cannot The Masters only speak one language They spoke it to me for many years I know it better than my mother tongue If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them May it be the last thing they ever hear

Tyrion Lannister : You may be right

Grey Worm : So we will fight them?

Tyrion Lannister : Possibly

Missandei : Possibly?

Tyrion Lannister : It's a conversation

Tyrion Lannister : Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis

Varys : Of course Man can be fickle, but birds always trust

Qyburn : Your eye looks much better, Arthur How's your mother's jaw?

Arthur : Better

Qyburn : And your father?

Arthur : No one's seen him

Qyburn : And no one will That worked out rather nicely

Little Bird : Will Lord Varys ever come back?

Qyburn : I don't think so Do you miss him?

Little Bird : He was nice

Arthur : He called us his little birds He gave us sweets

Qyburn : It's funny you should mention that Guess what I happened to find today Candied plums from Dorne

Qyburn : Now remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me All I need in return are whispers

Qyburn : No need to be afraid This is Ser Gregor He's friends with all my friends

Qyburn : Run along now

Cersei Lannister : Varys's little birds

Qyburn : Your little birds now, your Grace

Jaime Lannister : What did you do to him exactly I haven't been able to get a clear answer

Qyburn : Oh, a number of things

Jaime Lannister : Does he understand what we're saying I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place

Qyburn : He understands well enough

Jaime Lannister : So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow's head like a melon

Cersei Lannister : The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him Ser Gregor will can't face them all And he won't have to He'll only have to face one

Jaime Lannister : Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?

Cersei Lannister : Not yet

Jaime Lannister : That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching

Cersei Lannister : Don't stop at the city I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear I want to know who they are I want to where they are

Maester Pycelle : As bad as Lord Varys was Varys was, Qyburn is worse I told them all I told them He's arrogant, dangerous You don't get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason And no one listened to my advice, so here we are

Maester Pycelle : And what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination We never sanctioned this, this experiment And I for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest --

Kevan : Can I help you

Cersei Lannister : Why are you here

Mace Tyrell : My mother...

Lady Olenna : I was invited, my dear, o help deal with several troublesome issues, such as the queen's imprisonment

Cersei Lannister : Thank you for bringing it up It's well past time we addressed the abuses I endured

Lady Olenna : Margaery is the queen You are not the queen because you're not married to the king I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family

Kevan : This is a Small Council meeting You have no position on the Small Council

Jaime Lannister : I'm Lord Commander of the Kingsguard The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council

Cersei Lannister : Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?

Maester Pycelle : Well, um...I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King's council Of course, that was the Mad King King Robert saw things differently

Cersei Lannister : What about Myrcella's death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?

Jaime Lannister : The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne We've got a lot to discuss All of us together

Cersei Lannister : And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it

Kevan : No, we cannot make you leave And you cannot make us stay Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all

Sparrow : Oh, your Grace

Tommen Lannister : My mother would like to see her daughter's final resting place

Sparrow : Oh, I'm, sorry, your Grace That's not possible Not yet

Tommen Lannister : When will it be possible?

Sparrow : When she's fully atoned for her sins

Tommen Lannister : You've cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city That wasn't a full atonement?

Sparrow : No She must stand trial before seven septons, so we can learn the true extant of her sins

Tommen Lannister : I want you to let her see Myrcella's resting place

Tommen Lannister : I am the king

Sparrow : You are

Tommen Lannister : And what does that mean to you

Sparrow : It means a great deal to me The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world Do you know who told me that Your mother

Tommen Lannister : My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you've put her through?

Sparrow : How do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mother's presence? It was through their own mothers There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei, you know that But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world Because it doesn't come from this world But you know that You've felt it You've seen her when she talks to you

Tommen Lannister : Yes

Sparrow : It's a great gift One I never had Envy One more thing for me to atone for

Sparrow : You Grace, may I? Do you mind? It's my knees

Tommen Lannister : Of course

Sparrow : When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you

Tommen Lannister : I still don't understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured

Sparrow : It's not what I want It's what the gods want They make their will known to us and it's up to us to either accept or reject it

Sparrow : Please

Sparrow : If we're to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can And no one is wiser than the gods

Tommen Lannister : My grandfather once said something similar Except for the part about the gods

Sparrow : The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not As they work through your mother There's so much good in all of us The best we can do is to help each other bring it out

Waif : Who are you

Arya Stark : No one

Waif : Who were you before you came here

Arya Stark : Arya Stark

Waif : Tell me about Arya Stark's family

Arya Stark : Her father was Eddard Stark Her mother was Catelyn Stark She had one sister, Sansa, and four brothers

Arya Stark : Three brothers

Arya Stark : Rob, Bran, Rickon And a half-brother, Jon

Waif : And where are they now?

Arya Stark : They may be dead for all a girl knows

Waif : Tell me about The Hound

Arya Stark : Also dead

Arya Stark : Arya Stark left him to die He was on her list

Arya Stark : He was not on her list anymore She'd taken him off it

Waif : Why? Didn't she want him dead any longer

Arya Stark : She did and she did not

Waif : She sounds confused

Arya Stark : Yes, she was

Waif : Who else was on Arya Stark's funny little list?

Arya Stark : Cersei Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Walder Frey

Waif : That's a short list That can't be everyone you want to kill

Waif : Are you sure you're not forgetting someone

Arya Stark : Which name would you like a girl to speak?

Jaqen Hghar : If a girl tells me her name, I will give her eyes back

Arya Stark : A girl has no name

Jaqen Hghar : Come

Jaqen Hghar : If a girl is truly no one, she has nothing to fear

Jaqen Hghar : Who are you?

Ramsay Bolton : The Umbers are a famously loyal house

Lord Karstark : Famously loyal to the Starks

Smalljon : And you, Lord Karstark Your people share blood with the Starks, don't they? But here we are Times change

Ramsay Bolton : When my father became Warden of the North, your house refused to pledge their banners

Smalljon : Your father was a cunt

Ramsay Bolton : My beloved father, the Warden --

Smalljon : Your father was a cunt and that's why you killed him I might've done the same to my father, if he hadn't have done me the favor of dying on his own

Ramsay Bolton : My father was poisoned by our enemies

Smalljon : Mmm

Ramsay Bolton : Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?

Smalljon : The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall We're farther north than any of you fuckers Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first I like fighting wildlings, been doing it all my life But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone

Ramsay Bolton : So now you've come seeking help?

Smalljon : We need to help each other The colder it gets, the farther South those goat fuckers will roam Won't take them long to get here

Lord Karstark : You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell

Smalljon : If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe He knows this place better than we ever will

Ramsay Bolton : Pledge your banners to House Bolton Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends

Smalljon : I'm not kissing your fucking hand

Ramsay Bolton : Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord

Smalljon : I'm not doing that either

Ramsay Bolton : Why would I trust a man who won't honor tradition?

Smalljon : Your father honored tradition Knelt for Robb Stark Called him King of the North Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?

Ramsay Bolton : Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse

Smalljon : Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths I've got a gift for you

Ramsay Bolton : A girl, I hope I prefer redheads

Smalljon : A girl, aye A wild one

Ramsay Bolton : I like them wild

Smalljon : And the boy, nice and young The way Karstark likes them

Ramsay Bolton : Who's this?

Smalljon : Rickon Stark

Ramsay Bolton : How do I know that's Rickon Stark?

Ramsay Bolton : Welcome home, Lord Stark

Dolorous Edd : It's time

Jon Snow : If you have any last words, now is the time

Bowen Marsh : You shouldn't be alive It's not right

Jon Snow : Neither was killing me

Othell Yarwick : My mother's still living at White Harbor Could you write her? Tell her I died fighting the wildings

Alliser Throne : I had a choice, Lord Commander Betray you or betray the Night's Watch You brought an army of wildlings into our lands An army of muderers and raiders If I had to do it all over knowing where I'd end up, I pray I'd make the right choice again

Jon Snow : I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser

Alliser Throne : I fought, I lost Now I rest But you, Lord Snow, you'll be fighting their battles forever

Dolorous Edd : We should burn the bodies

Jon Snow : You should

Dolorous Edd : What do you want me to do with this?

Jon Snow : Wear it Burn it Whatever you want You have Castle Black

Jon Snow : My watch is ended

Dolorous Edd : Where you gonna go?

Jon Snow : South

Dolorous Edd : What are you gonna do?

Jon Snow : Get warm

Dolorous Edd : I was with you at Hardhome We saw what's out there We know it's coming here How can you leave us now?

Jon Snow : I did everything I could You know that

Dolorous Edd : You swore a vow

Jon Snow : Aye, I pledged my life to the Night's Watch I gave my life

Dolorous Edd : For all nights to come

Jon Snow : They killed me, Edd! My own brothers You want me to stay here after that?

Man : Riders approaching!

Man : Open the gate!

Sansa Stark : This is good soup Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?

Jon Snow : With the peas and onions?

Sansa Stark : Mmm

Jon Snow : We never should have left Winterfell

Sansa Stark : Don't you wish we could go back to the day we left? I want to scream at myself, "Don't go, you idiot"�

Jon Snow : How could we know?

Sansa Stark : I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you I wish I could change everything

Jon Snow : We were children

Sansa Stark : I was awful, just admit it

Jon Snow : You were occasionally awful I'm sure I can't have been great fun Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played

Sansa Stark : Can you forgive me?

Jon Snow : There's nothing to forgive

Sansa Stark : Forgive me

Jon Snow : All right All right, I forgive you

Jon Snow : You'd think after thousands of years, the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale

Sansa Stark : Where will you go?

Jon Snow : Where will we go? If I don't watch over you, Father's ghost will come back and murder me

Sansa Stark : Where will we go?

Jon Snow : I can't stay here, not after what happened

Sansa Stark : There's only one place we can go Home

Jon Snow : Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?

Sansa Stark : We'll take it back from them

Jon Snow : I don't have an army

Sansa Stark : How many wildlings did you save?

Jon Snow : They didn't come here to serve me

Sansa Stark : They owe you their lives

Sansa Stark : You think they'll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?

Jon Snow : Sansa

Sansa Stark : Winterfell is our home It's ours and Arya's and Bran's and Rickon's Wherever they are, it belongs to our family We have to fight for it

Jon Snow : I'm tired of fighting

Jon Snow : It's all I've done since I left home I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch I've killed wildlings I've killed men that I admire I hanged a boy younger than Bran I fought and I lost

Sansa Stark : If we don't take back the North, we'll never be safe I want you to help me But I'll do it myself if I have to

Davos : My lady

Melisandre : Ser Davos

Davos : Will you stay here at Castle Black?

Melisandre : I will do as Jon Snow commands

Davos : You serve Jon Snow now?

Melisandre : He's the prince that was promised

Davos : Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis

Davos : What happened down there?

Melisandre : There was a battle Stannis was defeated

Davos : And Shireen? What happened to the princess?

Brienne : I saw what happened I saw Stannis' forces defeated in the field

Davos : My lady, I'm Ser Davos Seaworth

Brienne : We've met before I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic

Davos : That's in the past now

Brienne : Yes, it's in the past It doesn't mean I forget Or forgive He admitted it, you know

Davos : Who did?

Brienne : Stannis Just before I executed him

Petyr Baelish : The Defender of the Vale!

Robin : Uncle Petyr!

Petyr Baelish : My lord Come and see

Petyr Baelish : I missed your name day Go on

Robin : A falcon!

Petyr Baelish : A gyrfalcon The greatest and rarest of birds

Yohn Royce : Last time I saw you, Baelish, you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers.

Petyr Baelish : Indeed I was

Yohn Royce : And yet not long ago, we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell

Petyr Baelish : On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting

Yohn Royce : Do you take me for a fool?

Petyr Baelish : Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else

Yohn Royce : Slander a man in his own home, you might find yourself crossing swords with him

Petyr Baelish : Your home is the Vale The Lord of the Vale stands before us And only his judgment concerns me

Robin : Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?

Yohn Royce : My lord My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn To your father, to your mother, and now to you.

Robin : Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?

Petyr Baelish : Lord Royce has served the Vale well He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come

Yohn Royce : You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord

Petyr Baelish : I think he deserves one more chance What do you say?

Robin : Fine

Petyr Baelish : I bring good news My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell I expect she's headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander But she won't be safe there, not with the Boltons after her

Robin : She's my cousin We should help her

Petyr Baelish : That was my instinct as well

Petyr Baelish : Our lord has spoken Gather the Knights of the Vale The time has come to join the fray

Grey Worm : You invite the enemy into our city?

Tyrion Lannister : I did As a clever man once told me, "We make peace with our enemies, not our friends"�

Grey Worm : I don't make peace with the queen's enemies I kill the queen's enemies

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, that's the military approach And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach

Missandei : Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her

Tyrion Lannister : We enter these negotiations with open eyes Trust me My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution

Missandei : How many days were you a slave?

Tyrion Lannister : Long enough to know

Missandei : Not long enough to understand

Yezzan : I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor And somehow you've risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen It's most impressive

Tyrion Lannister : And now you speak for the Good Masters of AstaporHere's to reversals of fortune

Razdal : We came here to meet the queen and instead we're greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch

Tyrion Lannister : Let's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want

Belicho : We want you to leave Slaver's Bay Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go

Tyrion Lannister : Queen Daenerys won't stay in Meereen forever Her path takes her westward

Razdal : When we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs She refused them

Missandei : She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains

Razdal : As they have since the dawn of time

Grey Worm : Not anymore

Yezzan : You think you're a free man now? You still follow orders Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn't mean she's not a master

Tyrion Lannister : Friends, friends, friends, please

Tyrion Lannister : There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing That is the way of the world I'm not here to change the way of the world

Yezzan : Slavery is the way of our world

Tyrion Lannister : You don't need slaves to make money There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it So here is the queen's proposal Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver's Bay time to adjust to the new order

Yezzan : What does that mean?

Tyrion Lannister : Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice

Tyrion Lannister : Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy

Yezzan : We do not support the Sons of the Harpy

Tyrion Lannister : Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same I do hope you accept, my friends You will not receive a better offer

Tyrion Lannister : Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it And as a parting gift to our honored guests.

Tyrion Lannister : Give freedom a chance See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before

Tyrion Lannister : My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time

Missandei : Perhaps I should translate for you

Man : We speak the Common Tongue

Tyrion Lannister : Excellent

Man : You met with the slavers today

Tyrion Lannister : I did

Man : Our brothers and sister died fighting these scum Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them

Tyrion Lannister : I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled

Tyrion Lannister : But I am not your ruler I'm not the Breaker of Chains I'm not the Unburnt And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons

Man : You are a stranger here So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?

Tyrion Lannister : Because our queen chose me as her advisor Until she returns from her travels --

Man : When does she return?

Tyrion Lannister : Soon You have my word

Man : We don't know you We don't trust you We know Torgo Nudho We fight with him against the Masters We trust him

Tyrion Lannister : And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace

Man : You have made peace with the slavers?

Tyrion Lannister : We offered terms

Man : And you, Grey Worm? You want to drink wine with these men? The men who tore us from our mothers' arms and sold us at auction like cattle?

Grey Worm : I am a soldier, not a politician But if there is a chance for peace -- a just peace -- we should take it

Man : Missandei, you know what these men are How can you trust them?

Missandei : I do not trust them I will never trust them

Missandei : But as a wise man once said, "We make peace with our enemies, not our friends"�

Grey Worm : Do not use me for your lies

Tyrion Lannister : Those men respect you

Grey Worm : They respect me because they know who I am They know I am loyal

Tyrion Lannister : As do I

Grey Worm : I am loyal to my queen, not you If you betray her work, you are my enemy

Tyrion Lannister : I am not betraying her work I am trying to save her city

Missandei : You promised the slavers they could keep slavery

Tyrion Lannister : For a short time

Missandei : Seven years is not a short time for a slave

Tyrion Lannister : You're right Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once War is a horror that should be ended at once I can't do both today

Grey Worm : You are wrong to trust these men

Tyrion Lannister : I don't trust the Masters I trust their self-interest They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest

Grey Worm : You don't know them You don't understand them We are not human in their eyes They look at me and see a weapon They look at her and see a whore

Tyrion Lannister : They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast Their contempt is their weakness They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage

Grey Worm : You will not use them They will use you That is what they do

Daario : You all right? Why don't you sit and catch your breath?

Jorah Mormont : I'm fine

Daario : I don't think you could ride the dragon 20 years ago, maybe

Jorah Mormont : What?

Daario : Our queen She's wild, you know Don't let her size fool you It's hard enough for me and I'm a young man You, I don't think your heart could take it

Daario : Must make you angry that our queen chose me

Jorah Mormont : Makes me sad You'll disappoint her before long She'll move on

Daario : We'll all disappoint her before long

Jorah Mormont : We need each other right now After we're done needing each other --

Daario : Oh, I don't want to fight you, Jorah the Andal What do I have to gain? If I win, I'm the shit who killed an old man If I lose, I'm the shit who was killed by an old man

Jorah Mormont : You didn't get much discipline as a child, did you?

Daario : None

Jorah Mormont : The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway

Jorah Mormont : Eastern Market, Western Market When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of the dead khals That's where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen

Daario : What are you doing?

Jorah Mormont : It's forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city

Daario : Isn't it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?

Jorah Mormont : If they spot us and we're unarmed, we'll say we're traders heading for the Western Market But if they see weapons.

Daario : You're asking a dog to hand over his teeth

Jorah Mormont : There's 100,000 of them down there We can't fight our way out We wait till dark, and then we'll find her

Daario : Uh.

Daario : I'm very attached to this knife

Jorah Mormont : Don't worry it didn't touch you

Daario : You know what happens?

Jorah Mormont : I know what happens

Daario : I'll do it myself.

Daario : I should have been born a Dothraki

Jorah Mormont : Come on

Jorah Mormont : My friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost Could you show us the way back?

Dothraki : What do you sell?

Jorah Mormont : Wine Come down to my stall tomorrow, I'll give you a cask of the Arbor's finest

Dothraki : You're not merchants

Dothraki : Get the others

Daario : Told you, I'm very attached to this knife

Daario : You all right?

Jorah Mormont : If they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us

Daario : Huh

Leader : Some of them don't think Dothraki should breed with foreigners They are stupid old women They don't realize that we have always diluted our blood This one is Lhazareen Her Khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village How old were you?

Lhazareen Woman : Twelve

Leader : A year later, she bore her Khal a daughter How did he show his happiness?

Lhazareen Woman : He broke my ribs

Leader : We are not queens here, but the khals depend on us for our wisdom Our lives have meaning

Daenerys Targaryen : That is more than most have

Leader : When the khals meet for the Khalar Vezhven tomorrow night, I hope they let you live out your days with us The other possibilities are not so pleasant

Daenerys Targaryen : I need to make water

Leader : You can't run from Dothraki You know this

Daenerys Targaryen : I will never run from Dothraki

Leader : Go, show her

Daenerys Targaryen : I needed fresh air The old women stink

Lhazareen Woman : They do stink

Daenerys Targaryen : You must have been very young when your Khal died

Lhazareen Woman : Sixteen

Daenerys Targaryen : Too bad he didn't die sooner

Lhazareen Woman : Yes, too bad

Lhazareen Woman : Is it true you have three dragons?

Daenerys Targaryen : Mm-hmm

Lhazareen Woman : And they breathe fire?

Daenerys Targaryen : They do Would you like to see them one day?

Lhazareen Woman : I am Dosh Khaleen I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, until I rise as smoke from the pyre on the day I die

Daenerys Targaryen : No, don't hurt her

Daario : She'll give us away

Jorah Mormont : We have to go now

Daenerys Targaryen : We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive

Jorah Mormont : All we can do is try

Daenerys Targaryen : No We can do more than that And you're going to help me

Daenerys Targaryen : And you...Have faith in me, Khaleesi Do not betray me

Sparrow : If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go? What would you seek out?

Margaery Tyrell : I'd go to my brother, my husband, my family

Sparrow : Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power Seeking out your family means seeking out sin I'm not maligning you I sought those things out, too. To the exclusion of all else My father was a cobbler He died with I was young and I took over his shop He was a simple man and he made simple shoes But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time Time most of all Dozens of hours spent on a single pair

Margaery Tyrell : Quality takes time

Sparrow : Yes I imagine you've worn a year of someone's life on your back The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself Each time I indulged, I felt myself ascending to something better

Margaery Tyrell : And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness Book of the Stranger, verse 25

Sparrow : You know

Margaery Tyrell : Septa Unella reads it to me At me

Sparrow : Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people You're close But it wasn't a graveyard It was a feast I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor I woke before dawn I could barely stand Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes The truth of their bodies laid bare I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn And I saw it with perfect clarity I saw what my sins were The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position It was all part of a story A story I was telling myself about who I was A collection of lies that would disappear in the light The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was

Margaery Tyrell : So what did you do?

Sparrow : I left to go and find them I didn't even put on my shoes I walked out the door and never went back

Sparrow : Come, let's go and see him

Margaery Tyrell : Who?

Sparrow : Your brother

Margaery Tyrell : enters her brother's cell. The door closes and locks behind her. Loras is lying on the floor.

Margaery Tyrell : Loras. Loras.

Margaery Tyrell : helps LORAS to his knees. He cries.

Margaery Tyrell : Listen to me. You need to stay strong.

Loras : I can't stay strong. I never was strong.

Margaery Tyrell : You are strong. You are the future of our house, the future of our family.

Loras : I don't care about that.

Margaery Tyrell : Shh. Have you -- have you told them that? That you don't care?

Loras : I just want it to stop. Help me.

Margaery Tyrell : They want me to help you. They want me told help tear you down. That's why he's letting me see you, I know it is. And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win.

Loras : Let them win. Just make it stop. Please.

Loras : begins sobbing. MARGAERY embraces him.

Margaery Tyrell : All right.

Cersei Lannister : is walking down the hall to TOMMEN's chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking.

Maester Pycelle : And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament. This High Sparrow. I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace. Not setting them off, that's the most important thing. You are beset with enemies both within and without.

Cersei Lannister : enters the room

Cersei Lannister : What are you doing here?

Maester Pycelle : I am advising the king on our current predicament.

Cersei Lannister : Leave.

Maester Pycell : I am a member of the Small Council. The king's small --

Cersei Lannister : Is this a Small Council meeting?

Maester Pycell : Obviously not. I'm here to lend my wisdom and my support.

Tommen Lannister : Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester. That will be all for now.

Maester Pycell : Your Grace.

Maester : PYCELLE hobbles towards the door. As he leaves, he flashes CERSEI a smile. CERSEI closes the door.

Cersei Lannister : Since I've missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things.

Tommen Lannister : I've been thinking about the High Sparrow.

Cersei Lannister : As have we all, unfortunately.

Tommen Lannister : We need to be careful in dealing with such a man. To prevent things from escalating any further. We have to be careful not to antagonize him. He has Margaery. We can't put her at risk. He's dangerous.

Cersei Lannister : Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king's own mother?

Cersei Lannister : It's all right. It's done. It's in the past. And of course Margaery's safety is paramount.

Tommen Lannister : You don't like Margaery, do you?

Cersei Lannister : Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing.

Tommen Lannister : Mother...there's something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.

Cersei Lannister : You've spoken with him?

Tommen Lannister : I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone. If he found out I told --

Cersei Lannister : It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me.

Kevan : and LADY OLENNA are waiting in the Small Council chamber for the meeting to start. CERSEI and JAIME enter.

Cersei Lannister : The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders.

Kevin : and LADY OLENNA stand up.

Lady Olenna : I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time. You're not welcome.

Cersei Lannister : You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.

Lady Olenna : My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What's left to work with?

Jaime Lannister : Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king's ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.

Cersei Lannister : The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he'll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city.

Lady Olenna : Oh, no. That cannot happen. That will not happen.

Cersei Lannister : I agree.

Jaime Lannister : You've got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody.

Kevan : The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen's safety.

Jaime Lannister : You'll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?

Kevan : No, but if the king should call on me --

Jaime Lannister : The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen's side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?

Cersei Lannister : You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they've done to your son. Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?

Kevan : Of course I want him back.

Cersei Lannister : Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.

Kevan : If it doesn't go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city. We'll have civil war. Many will die.

Lady Olenna : Many will die no matter what we do. Better them than us.

Theon Greyjoy : approaches Pyke Castle by boat.

Yara Greyjoy : They told me you were home and I didn't believe it. "Theon Greyjoy?"� I said. "He's dead. He's been dead a long time." He let you go?

Theon Greyjoy : I escaped.

Yara Greyjoy : I can't hear you.

Yara Greyjoy : Look at me. Look at me! Men died trying to rescue you. Good men. My men.

Theon Greyjoy : I'm sorry.

Yara Greyjoy : You were my brother. You're a spoiled little cunt, but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me.

Theon Greyjoy : I know. I know and I'm sorry.

Yara Greyjoy : Stop saying that.

Theon Greyjoy : He broke me. He broke me into a thousand pieces.

Yara Greyjoy : I know.

Theon Greyjoy : You don't know.

Yara Greyjoy : He send us one of those pieces. That's why I came for you.

Yara Greyjoy : Why did you come here?

Theon Greyjoy : Where else could I go?

Yara Greyjoy : You heard father was dead and thought you'd claim the crown?

Theon Greyjoy : No, no. I only heard he died after we docked.

Yara Greyjoy : You happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot?

Theon Greyjoy : I didn't know.

Yara Greyjoy : You think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what you've done?

Theon Greyjoy : I don't want to be king.

Yara Greyjoy : What do you want?

Theon Greyjoy : I shouldo ve listened to you. You're the only one --

Yara Greyjoy : That doesn't matter anymore. Stop crying. Look at me. Tell me what you want.

Theon Greyjoy : You should rule the Iron Islands. Let me help you.

Ramsay Bolton : peels an apple with a knife. The door opens. A guard ushers OSHA into the room. RAMSAY nods. The guard leaves and closes the door.

Ramsay Bolton : They've cleaned you up nicely. You know who I am?

Osha : A lord?

Ramsay Bolton : Yes. A lord. You've seen my banners?

Osha : The flayed man.

Ramsay Bolton : Does that worry you at all?

Osha : You eat them after?

Ramsay Bolton : No.

Osha : Then I've seen worse.

Ramsay Bolton : peels the skin of the apple and puts it on the table with the knife. OSHA looks at the knife. RAMSAY waves for OSHA to come to him. She walks towards him.

Ramsay Bolton : You served the Starks?

Osha : Aye. They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat, so I've served them.

Ramsay Bolton : The Starks have been gone for a long time, but you kept protecting Rickon.

Osha : He'd fetch a good price to the right buyer. I served his family a long time. Didn't get no wages. Way I see it, I'm owed.

Ramsay Bolton : Be that as it may, Rickon's not yours to sell anymore. He's mine. So what use could I possibly have for you?

Osha : I can give you what you want.

Ramsay Bolton : Are you sure you know what that is?

Osha : comes closer and sits down on his lap. They kiss.

Osha : Same thing men always want. And when they really want it, they give it a bath first.

Ramsay Bolton : You're a good talker.

Ramsay Bolton : I like that.

Ramsay Bolton : You're a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.

Osha : That so?

Ramsay Bolton : I had to work hard to get him talking. But he talked. They all do.

Ramsay Bolton : He told me everything. All about the Stark boys. Who helped them escape, and how she did it.

Osha : gets up and tries to stab RAMSAY with the knife, but RAMSAY stabs her in the neck first. She falls on the ground, with blood running from her neck. She dies. RAMSAY cleans his knife and continues to peel the apple. He bites a piece.

Sansa Stark : JON SNOW, BRIENNE, TORMUND, and DOLOROUS EDD are eating at a table. SANSA looks at the meat on her fork. JON SNOW, DOLOROUS EDD, and TORMUND eat vigorously. BRIENNE looks around at the men eating. TORMUND stares intently at BRIENNE. BRIENNE looks away. TORMUND smiles. DOLOROUS EDD notices their interaction.

Dolorous Edd : Sorry about the food. It's not what we're known for.

Sansa Stark : That's all right. There are more important things.

Man : A letter for you, Lord Commander.

Jon Snow : I'm not Lord Commander anymore.

Jon Snow : SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading.

Jon Snow : To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.

Jon Snow : SNOW looks at SANSA.

Jon Snow : His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You --

Sansa Stark : Go on.

Jon Snow : It's just more of the same.

Jon Snow : SNOW puts the letter away, but SANSA takes it and continues reading.

Sansa Stark : You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister. You will watch as my dogs your wild little brother. Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest. Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.

Jon Snow : Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.

Sansa Stark : His father's dead. Ramsay killed him. And now he has Rickon.

Jon Snow : We don't know that.

Sansa Stark : Yes, we do.

Tormund : How many men does he have in his army?

Sansa Stark : I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis's attack.

Jon Snow : How many do you have?

Tormund : That can march and fight? 2,000. The rest are children and old people.

Sansa Stark : You're the son of the last true Warden of the North. Northern families are loyal. They'll fight for you if you ask.

Sansa Stark : A monster has taken our home and our brother. We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.

Jon Snow : SNOW nods.

Khal Moro : It is forbidden to spill blood in the sacred city. It is forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.

Khal : So we don't spill blood.

Khal Moro : Well. there's always a little blood.

Khal : Someone crushed his head with a rock.

Khal Moro : Aggo belonged to my khalaser. He served me well. He got his head smashed in by a rock. Fuck Aggo.

Khal : 1 sits down.

Khal Moro : Bring in Drogo's widow.

Daenerys Targaryen : enters, ushered by the Lhazareen woman and the leader of the Dosh Khaleen. The khals bow their heads.

Khal : Who cares about her? She's a midget.

Khal : I like her.

Khal : She's paler than milk.

Khal : I'd like to know what a khaleesi tastes like.

Khal : Good. You can suck my dick.

Khal Moro : She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen.

Khal : The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her. They're offering ten thousand horses In exchange. What's worth more, one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?

Khal Moro : Fuck the Wise Masters in their perfumed asses. I'll take their horses for myself.

Daenerys Targaryen : Don't you want to know what I think?

Khal Moro : You'd rather be sold to slavery? Or maybe you'd like to show Rhalko here what you taste like?

Daenerys Targaryen : No. I don't want either of those things.

Khal Moro : We don't care what you want. This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen. You have no voice here, unless you are Dosh Khaleen. Which you are not, until we decide you are.

Daenerys Targaryen : I know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.

Khal Moro : And what happened? You trusted a sorceress, like a fool. Your baby is dead because of you. And so is Khal Drogo.

Daenerys Targaryen : This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.

Khal Moro : And you were dumb enough to believe him?

Daenerys Targaryen : And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you'll raid, how many girls you'll get to fuck, how many horses you'll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will.

Khal Moro : All right. No Dosh Khaleen for you. Instead we'll take turns fucking you. And then we'll let our bloodriders fuck you.

Khal Moro : And If there's anything left of you, we'll give our horses a turn. You crazy cunt. Did you really think we would serve you?

Daenerys Targaryen : lays her hand on a fire pit.

Daenerys Targaryen : You're not going to serve. You're going to die.

Daenerys Targaryen : knocks down all the fire pits one by one. The khals cower away from the flame. The flame begins to cover the entire temple. The khals run to the door and try to escape, but the door has been barred. JORAH and DAARIO watch the temple burning from the outside. The Dothraki people gather around the burning temple. DAENERYS grabs the final fire pit and knocks it in KHAL MORO's direction. The fire engulfs the entire temple and kills all the khals. DAENERYS walks out of the fire, unharmed and naked. All the Dothraki bow to DAENERYS. JORAH and DAARIO walk up to the steps burning temple. JORAH bows to DAENERYS. DAARIO stares at her and then bows.

Sansa Stark : Yes?

Man : For you, my lady.

Sansa Stark : How far is Mole's Town?

Petyr Baelish : Sansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed.

Sansa Stark : Unharmed? What are you doing here?

Petyr Baelish : I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. They're encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.

Sansa Stark : To come to my aid? Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn't know, you're an idiot. If you did know, you're my enemy.

Sansa Stark : Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark's daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?

Petyr Baelish : I can't begin to contemplate --

Sansa Stark : What do you think he did to me?

Brienne : Lady Sansa asked you a question.

Petyr Baelish : He beat you.

Sansa Stark : Yes, he enjoyed that. What else do you think he did?

Petyr Baelish : Sansa, I --

Sansa Stark : What else?

Petyr Baelish : Did he cut you?

Sansa Stark : Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.

Petyr Baelish : I didn't know.

Sansa Stark : I thought you knew everyone's secrets.

Petyr Baelish : I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger.

Sansa Stark : The other things he did, ladies aren't supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time. I can still feel it. I don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so. I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.

Petyr Baelish : I'm so sorry.

Sansa Stark : You said you would protect me.

Petyr Baelish : And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.

Sansa Stark : I don't believe you anymore. I don't need you anymore. You can't protect me. You won't even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. And why shouldn't I?

Petyr Baelish : Do you want me to beg for my life? If that's what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do.

Sansa Stark : What if I want you to die here and now?

Petyr Baelish : Then I will die.

Sansa Stark : You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family. Go back to Moat Cailin. My brother and I will take back the North on our own. I never want to see you again.

Petyr Baelish : I would do anything to undo what's been done to you. I know that I can't. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.

Sansa Stark : I have an army.

Petyr Baelish : Your brother's army.

Petyr Baelish : Half-brother.

Waif : You're not ready. You should go home before it's too late.

Waif : You'll never be one of us, Lady Stark.

Jaqen Hghar : She has a point.

Jaqen Hghar : None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies. They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria.

Arya Stark : Who was the first?

Jaqen Hghar : He was no one. The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift. The man taught others in exchange for their service. Many served, many more gifts were given. Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled.

Arya Stark : Where did they go?

Jaqen Hghar : Here. They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house. These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others. The first Faceless Men. And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires.

Arya Stark : A girl has no desires.

Arya Stark : Who?

Jaqen Hghar : An actress who calls herself Lady Crane. She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square. A girl has been given a second chance. There will not be a third. One way or another, a face will be added to the hall.

Izembaro : Ahh!

Izembaro : Oh, murdered by a boar. The great big hairy whore. He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts and soon I am no more.

Clarenzo : Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie. I love you, Father. Please don't die.

Izembaro : Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.

Ladyc Rane : I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land. And our son alone on that cold, cold throne without a guiding hand. Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace? To whom will he turn when it's time to learn to look darkness in the face?

Izembaro : Ned stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.

Camello : Ooh! Ooh, what's happened here, then?

Bobono : He brought you here, Ned Stark, 'cause you're the brightest fellow in the land. You should be king of us all and I should be your Hand.

Camello : We men of the North are right good hands at keeping people lawful.

Camello : I'd ask him for permission, but he smells too bloody awful.

Izembaro : I die! I die! And here I now must lie. Oh, woe. Oh, no. Oh, I am about to go.

Lady Crane : Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?

Camello : The Iron Throne's what I demand.

Lady Crane : You cannot.

Camello : I can.

Lady Crane : You will not.

Camello : I will.

Lady Crane : You dare not.

Camello : I dare yes.

Lady Crane : The line of succession.

Camello : What's that mean?

Lady Crane : The proper progression.

Lady Crane : The lawful ascension.

Camello : So move along, give me my chair and there won't be no more trouble.

Camello : But we had a deal all done and dusted.

Camello : I'm starting to think you can't be trusted.

Bianca : Save my father.

Lady Crane : Truly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.

Bianca : Save him, please.

Lady Crane : Show him mercy. Show the people what a good king should be.

Clarenzo : Good people, you may all relax. My father's friend shall be spared the "?

Bianca : Father! No! Oh, father.

Bobono : Worry not! All is well. I have here a decree from my father Tywin Lannister, the richest man you'll see. He proclaims me Hand of the King. The position's mine for life. And he's give me permission to take Sansa as my wife.

Bobono : You'll learn that what I lack in height I make up for in appetite.

Bobono : So let's forget about your plight, and go rehearse our wedding night.

Clarenzo : It's a wart. Two warts. I've got two fucking warts on my cock.

Camello : Well, don't worry, love. They usually go away in five or six years.

Camello : Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me.

Izembaro : You can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do.

Bianca : I had two lines.

Izembaro : There are no small parts. You rang very false.

Bianca : I rang very false?

Bobono : What you need, love, is for someone to ring you true.

Bianca : You weren't complaining about me last night.

Bobono : May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?

Lady Crane : I'm a rum girl, Bobono. You need to know that if we're going to be intimate.

Bobono : Of course we're going to be intimate.

Lady Crane : It's only a matter of time.

Lady Crane : To our children.

Bobono : May they have your talent.

Lady Crane : And your filthy mind.

Arya Stark : A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.

Arya Stark : If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall.

Jaqen Hghar : A girl is not ready.

Arya Stark : She's a good actress.

Jaqen Hghar : So a man has heard.

Arya Stark : Seems like a decent woman.

Jaqen Hghar : Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?

Arya Stark : No. Who wants her dead?

Jaqen Hghar : That does not matter. The price was paid.

Arya Stark : The younger actress. She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.

Jaqen Hghar : A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.

Arya Stark : A girl has decided.

Jaqen Hghar : A servant does not ask questions.

Man : No! No! No!

Bran Stark : It was you. You made the White Walkers.

Leaf : We were at war. We were being slaughtered. Our sacred trees cut down. We needed to defend ourselves.

Bran Stark : From whom?

Leaf : From you. From men.

Aeron : We speak in the presence of the Drowned God. In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader. Who makes a claim?

Yara Greyjoy : I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands. I claim the Salt Throne.

Man : We've never had a queen. Not once.

Yara Greyjoy : There are many things we've never done. We've never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist.

All : Aye!

Yara Greyjoy : We are a sea people.

Yara Greyjoy : Our god is a sea god.

Yara Greyjoy : When I am queen, we will build a fleet that "?

Man : You shall not be queen!

Yara Greyjoy : I am not finished!

Man : Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us. Not when Balon's own male heir has returned.

Theon Greyjoy : I am Theon Greyjoy...last living son of Balon Greyjoy.

Theon Greyjoy : And she is your rightful ruler. Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is.

Theon Greyjoy : She is a reaver!

Theon Greyjoy : She is a warrior!

Theon Greyjoy : She is ironborn!

Theon Greyjoy : We will find no better leader. This is our queen.

Euron Greyjoy : I'm Euron Greyjoy.

Euron Greyjoy : I claim the Salt Throne.

Euron Greyjoy : Niece.

Euron Greyjoy : Nephew. Little Theon.

Euron Greyjoy : Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn't keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.

Euron Greyjoy : Explains why you think a woman can be king.

Yara Greyjoy : When did you return, Uncle?

Euron Greyjoy : A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.

Yara Greyjoy : I'm glad you're here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.

Euron Greyjoy : I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren't for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn't win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.

Theon Greyjoy : That would have been hard to do. You weren't here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time.

Euron Greyjoy : Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?

Euron Greyjoy : Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?

Theon Greyjoy : You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.

Euron Greyjoy : And how will she do that?

Yara Greyjoy : I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.

Euron Greyjoy : Right idea, except I'm the one who's going to build the Iron Fleet because I'm the one who knows how to use it. I've been all over the world. I've seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I'm going to build that fleet and I'm going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock.

Yara Greyjoy : You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?

Euron Greyjoy : I'm not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we're going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn't born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.

Aeron : May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel.

Aerson : Listen to the waves. Listen to the god. He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy. Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away. Let the old Euron drown. Let his lungs fill with seawater.

Aeron : Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.

Aeron : What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger.

Aeron : What is dead may never die.

All : What is dead may never die.

Euron Greyjoy : Where are my niece and nephew? Let's go murder them.

Aeron : They stole our best ships.

Euron Greyjoy : Won't be enough to save them.

Euron Greyjoy : Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.

Daenerys Targaryen : I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can't take you back and I can't send you away.

Jorah Mormont : You must send me away.

Daenerys Targaryen : Is there a cure?

Jorah Mormont : I don't know.

Daenerys Targaryen : How long does it take?

Jorah Mormont : I don't know that either. But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough. I'll end things before that.

Daenerys Targaryen : I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

Jorah Mormont : Don't be. All I've ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I'll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal.

Daenerys Targaryen : You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.

Daenerys Targaryen : Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side.

Varys : In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?

Grey Worm : None.

Varys : And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.

Grey Worm : Two, but that was the day of the pact. Since then, nothing.

Varys : So it's safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.

Grey Worm : For now.

Varys : For now is the best we get in our profession.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not enough.

Varys : Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I'd say it's a good start.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that.

Missandei : The people know who brought them freedom.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced.

Varys : Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?

Tyrion Lannister : Who said anything about "him"�?

Man : You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light.

Tyrion Lannister : Welcome to Meereen.

Tyrion Lannister : That's about the extent of my Valyrian.

Tyrion Lannister : Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.

Tyrion Lannister : The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --

Kinvara : You don't need to persuade me. I came to help.

Kinvara : Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes.

Kinvara : She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.

Tyrion Lannister : She did indeed.

Kinvara : Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven't you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away.

Tyrion Lannister : Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.

Kinvara : You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she's gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed.

Tyrion Lannister : I'd settle for obeyed.

Kinvara : I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.

Tyrion Lannister : That sounds most excellent --

Varys : A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he'd been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good.

Tyrion Lannister : We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.

Varys : I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic? You're always right. Everything is the Lordo s will.

Kinvara : Everything is the Lordo s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.

Varys : And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?

Tyrion Lannister : My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.

Kinvara : Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn't be here helping the Lordo s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there's still so much you don't know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?

Kinvara : Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?

Kinvara : We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me.

Bran Stark : What?

Bran Stark : He saw me, the Night King! He saw me!

Threeeyed Raven : He touched you.

Bran Stark : I don't know. He was close, but --

Threeeyed Raven : He knows you are here. He'll come for you.

Bran Stark : But he can't get in.

Threeeyed Raven : He can now. His mark is on you. You must leave, all of you.

Meera : Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge.

Hodor : Hodor.

Bran Stark : I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

Threeeyed Raven : The time has come.

Bran Stark : The time for what?

Threeeyed Raven : For you to become me.

Bran Stark : But am I ready?

Threeeyed Raven : No.

Jon Snow : We can't defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men.

Davos : Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys.

Davos : The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we're not doing so well there.

Sansa Stark : The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.

Davos : I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don't think we can count on them either.

Sansa Stark : How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?

Davos : Precious little, my lady.

Sansa Stark : My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.

Davos : They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They're more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don't want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it's a fight they can win.

Jon Snow : There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build.

Sansa Stark : The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.

Davos : I don't doubt it. But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.

Sansa Stark : No, but I do.

Sansa Stark : Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's. Ant there are also the Tullys. They're not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question.

Davos : I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.

Sansa Stark : My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.

Jon Snow : How do you know that?

Sansa Stark : Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.

Davos : That's good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side.

Brienne : I've sworn to protect you, my lady.

Sansa Stark : You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.

Brienne : We can send the Blackfish a raven.

Sansa Stark : Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.

Sansa Stark : Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you'll know how to talk to him.

Sansa Stark : What is it?

Brienne : I don't like leaving you here alone.

Sansa Stark : With Jon?

Brienne : Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that's understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --

Sansa Stark : Jon isn't Tormund. Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He's my brother. He'll keep me safe. I trust him.

Brienne : Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?

Jon Snow : New dress?

Sansa Stark : I made it myself. Do you like it?

Jon Snow : Year, it's -- I like the wolf bit.

Sansa Stark : Good, because I made this for you.

Sansa Stark : I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.

Jon Snow : Thank you, Sansa.

Sansa Stark : You're welcome.

Jon Snow : Don't knock it down while I'm gone.

Dolorous Edd : I'll do my best.

Dolorous Edd : Good luck.

Man : Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?

Dolorous Edd : I'm not the Lord Comman --

Dolorous Edd : Yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate.

Meera : We can go home now, Hodor. Well, maybe not home home, but somewhere that isn't a cave.

Meera : Eat something that isn't moss. I want an egg. How do you like 'em? Boiled? Fried up with some butter?

Meera : With a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage.

Leaf : Get Bran and run!

Meera : Bran. Bran, wake up. Bran.

Hodor : Hodor. Hodor.

Meera : Bran, wake up.

Meera : Hodor.

Meera : Help me!

Rickard : Remember that you are a Stark. Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale and try to stay out of fights.

Young Ned : Yes, Father.

Rickard : But if you have to fight, win.

Meera : Bran! Bran, wake up!

Meera : Bran! Bran! Bran, wake up.

Meera : You have to wake up. We need Hodor.

Meera : Bran, we're all going to die!

Meera : Bran, wake up! We're all going to die! Bran! Bran!

Meera : Bran, you have to wake up! We need Hodor!

Meera : Warg into Hodor now!

Meera : Bran, wake up. We need Hodor. We need Hodor. Warg into Hodor now! Now!

Threeeyed Raven : Listen to your friend, Brandon.

Hodor : Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.

Meera : Summer!

Leaf : Go. Go!

Threeeyed Raven : The time has come. Leave me.

Meera : What are you doing?

Leaf : Go!

Meera : Hodor, hurry!

Meera : Hold the door!

Meera : Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door!

Nan : Wylis! What's the matter?

Young Hodor : Hold the door!

Young Hodor : Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door!

Young Hodor : Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold door! Hold door! Hold door! Hold door! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor! Hodor!

Bran Stark : Meera. They found us.

Meera : I'm so sorry.

Rider : Come with me, now.

Rider : The dead don't rest.

Gilly : It's so green.

Sam : Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer's over, you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else.

Gilly : You're nervous. You're a nervous talker.

Gilly : That's not any better being a nervous mute.

Sam : I didn't think I'd ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't. A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point.

Sam : And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.

Gilly : That Little Sam is your baby.

Sam : Yes, now that's very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in. He'll get an education. He'll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?

Gilly : What did you tell your family about me?

Sam : I told them I met you in the North.

Gilly : Did you tell them how far north?

Sam : Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment.

Gilly : You didn't tell them where I'm really from? You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?

Sam : The thing is...my father doesn't like wildlings. He hoped I'd make a man of myself by "killing some bloody wildlings,"� so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.

Gilly : I think we're here.

Melessa : Sam. Oh, Sam.

Sam : Oh, hello, Mother.

Melessa : I never thought I'd see you again. You look wonderful.

Sam : Oh.

Sam : Talla? Gods, you're a woman now.

Talla : Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway. He has yellow teeth- -

Melessa : That's enough, Talla.

Sam : Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly.

Melessa : Oh, my. You are lovely.

Gilly : I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.

Sam : Oh, and this, this is our son Samwell.

Melessa : Hello, little one. It's me, your grandmother.

Melessa : May I hold him?

Gilly : Yes, of course.

Melessa : You have a curious mind, I can tell. You'll be a scholar like your father.

Sam : Where is Father? And Dickon?

Melessa : They're on a hunt. They'll join us for dinner. Come inside. Such a journey. You must be exhausted.

Talla : Come, you'll be wanting a bath after all that travel. Oh, and a dress for dinner. You can wear one of mine. What's your color? Midnight blue or silver? Silver, maybe. Come. You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want.

Tommen Lannister : Is there no other way?

Sparrow : You're afraid for her?

Tommen Lannister : Of course I'm afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.

Sparrow : She'll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn't your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She's truly opened her heart to them.

Tommen Lannister : She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.

Sparrow : And now she's devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?

Tommen Lannister : Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?

Margaery Tyrell : No, Your Grace.

Tommen Lannister : I've missed you. More than you could know.

Margaery Tyrell : We'll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.

Tommen Lannister : Better how? Soon the- - walk of atonement. He says there's no other way.

Margaery Tyrell : Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?

Tommen Lannister : Yes, a few times. Have you?

Margaery Tyrell : Yes, I have. He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?

Margaery Tyrell : You think I'm mad. I sound mad.

Tommen Lannister : No. No, you don't. You- - you could never. You're right, he's not. He's a lot more- -

Margaery Tyrell : He is. There's something about him. His way of looking at the world. It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It's taken me a while. He's helped me.

Tommen Lannister : What are you talking about? You're a good person. You've always been a good person. You're the best person I know.

Tommen Lannister : I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.

Margaery Tyrell : Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories.

Tommen Lannister : I don't understand.

Margaery Tyrell : It's all right. It really is. It's such a relief to let go of those lies.

Tommen Lannister : What about Loras?

Margaery Tyrell : I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all.

Gilly : It's hard to walk in this.

Sam : It's beautiful. You're beautiful.

Sam : This venison, it's very tasty. Is it from today's hunt?

Dickon : Well, no. We haven't been able to cure that one yet. This is last week's.

Sam : Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey.

Dickon : Brought it down from 70 yards. One shot.

Sam : Oh, that's a fair distance.

Dickon : So do you do much hunting up at the wall?

Sam : Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don't hunt, you don't eat.

Dickon : Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?

Sam : Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say "we,"� it's my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She's- - she's quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress.

Melessa : I imagine it's common where you're from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.

Talla : Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.

Randyll : That's enough of that.

Melessa : Samwell, would you care for more bread?

Sam : Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother.

Randyll : Not fat enough already?

Sam : I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -

Randyll : I read your letter. You're to be a maester.

Sam : Yes. And once I have my chain, I'll return to Castle Black.

Randyll : I thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.

Randyll : Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I'll wager you still can't sit a horse or wield a sword.

Melessa : Randyll, to be maester of the Night's Watch is a great honor.

Gilly : He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.

Dickon : There's no such thing.

Gilly : I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker's heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.

Randyll : Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How'd you come to meet my son?

Gilly : The Night's Watch came to our keep.

Randyll : Where?

Sam : Gilly.

Gilly : North of the Wall.

Randyll : North of the Wall? You're a Wildling. The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son. See that sword?

Randyll : It's called Heartsbane. It's been in our family for 500 years. It's Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole's Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it. And you got what you were after, didn't you? A bastard. A half-breed bastard. Your invitation into our home.

Melessa : Come, my dear. Talla.

Melessa : I've lost my appetite.

Randyll : He dishonors us.

Melessa : You dishonor yourself.

Randyll : Your mother's a fine woman. You're not worthy of her. To please her, I'll take the wildling in. She can work in the kitchens. The bastard will be raised here. But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.

Sam : I'm sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.

Gilly : I'm not angry at you. I'm angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it. When do you have to go?

Sam : First light.

Sam : Say good-bye to him for me.

Gilly : You're not what he thinks you are, Sam. He doesn't know what you are.

Sam : Good-bye, Gilly.

Gilly : Sam?

Sam : We're leaving.

Gilly : What?

Sam : Get your things.

Gilly : I don't have any things.

Gilly : What are you doing?

Sam : We belong together. All of us.

Gilly : What about your mother and sister?

Sam : Oh, they'll understand.

Gilly : Your sister's dress.

Sam : She won't mind. Looks better on you anyway.

Gilly : Sam. That's your father's sword.

Sam : It's my family's sword.

Gilly : Sam. Won't he come for it?

Sam : He can bloody well try.

Clarenzo : The lion and the rose are one. I thank the gods above.

Clarenzo : And to you, my beauteous bridge, I pledge undying love.

All : Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.

Clarenzo : I'll drink a toast to my new queen, for there is no one fairer. Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?

Bobono : Drink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine.

Bobono : The last drink he shall ever take. And vengeance shall be mine.

Clarenzo : Poison! Murder! I gasp. I- - I die.

Clarenzo : I limp. And it was he.

Clarenzo : that poisoned me. My evil Uncle Imp.

Lady Crane : My firstborn son. My golden lion foully, falsely slain. I pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain.

Lady Crane : Hear my prayer, O cruel gods. Take my life instead. For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead. Oh, woe. Oh grief.

Lady Crane : Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow. All hope is lost. All joy is gone. And there is no tomorrow.

Bobono : What is that I hear and smell? Someone I'll soon send to hell.

Bobono : It's time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.

Izembaro : You beast. You beast. You killed my wife and now you've taken your father's life.

Izembaro : No worse child ever stained this land.

Izembaro : Curse the day I named you.

Bobono : My greatest crime. Now I must flee.

Bobono : Then sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery.

Bobono : Don't fear the winter.

Bobono : Fear me!

Izembaro : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca, Clarenzo.

Izembaro : I give you Bobono.

Izembaro : I give you Camello.

Izembaro : And last but not least, sweet Lady Crane.

Camello : Give this a good beating. Shake those fleas out. That's a dear.

Izembaro : That crowd was shit.

Lady Crane : Girl.

Lady Crane : What are you doing back here?

Arya Stark : Nothing.

Lady Crane : I saw you the other day in the audience. How many times have you seen this stupid play?

Arya Stark : Three times.

Lady Crane : Did you pay?

Arya Stark : No.

Lady Crane : I remember when the players came to my village. I didn't have any money, so I snuck in. Just like you. Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms. I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.

Arya Stark : You're very good.

Lady Crane : My final speech is shit.

Lady Crane : But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing's no good.

Arya Stark : So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.

Lady Crane : How would you change it?

Arya Stark : The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn't just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.

Lady Crane : What's your name?

Arya Stark : Mercy.

Lady Crane : You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.

Lady Crane : Wonderful eyebrows. Do you like pretending to be other people?

Arya Stark : I have to go. My father's waiting for me.

Bianca : Lady Crane, they loved you.

Lady Crane : They were sweet. Or drunk. Drunkenly sweet.

Izembaro : No laugh for Nedo s death. These people are worse than animals.

Izembaro : But they loved her. They all love her.

Camello : Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike.

Lady Crane : I do what I can with what I'm given.

Izembaro : With what you're given?

Lady Crane : Well, I was thinking- -

Izembaro : Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?

Izembaro : Full to the tits with ideas.

Lady Crane : I didn't mean- -

Izembaro : You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas. Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I've been doing this my whole life? Who is anyone to judge my work? This is my profession. I know what I'm doing.

Izembaro : You have no right to an opinion.

Arya Stark : Careful of that one. She wants you dead.

Jaqen Hghar : And?

Waif : As I expected.

Jaqen Hghar : A shame. A girl had many gifts.

Waif : You promised me.

Jaqen Hghar : Don't let her suffer.

Mace : My lord.

Jaime Lannister : My lord.

Mace : My friends, the hour has come. Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children. But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came. Madness has had its day!

Captain : Forward, march!

Sparrow : Rich or poor, noble or common, if we win, we must atone. Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner. She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied. She turned a blind eye to her brother's sins. She disgraces her house, the king, and herself.

Captain : Company, halt! Face front! Turn!

Sparrow : Lord Tyrell.

Sparrow : Ser Jaime.

Jaime Lannister : Sorry to interrupt. We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we'll be on our way.

Sparrow : I don't have the authority to give them to you. And you don't have the authority to take them.

Captain : Lock spears!

Jaime Lannister : I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name.

Sparrow : The gods don't recognize his authority in this matter.

Jaime Lannister : You already insulted one great house. It won't happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.

Sparrow : To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement.

Captain : Order up!

Sparrow : Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven.

Sparrow : Together we announce a new age of harmony. A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith.

Woman : Long live King Tommen and bless you, Queen Margaery!

Tommen Lannister : The crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests. Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.

Mace : What's happening?

Olenna Tyrell : He's beaten us. That's what's happening.

Tommen Lannister : When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown. Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

Jaime Lannister : I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything.

Tommen Lannister : I have to answer to the gods.

Jaime Lannister : Not when you're sitting in that chair.

Tommen Lannister : The Crown's decision on this matter is final.

Jaime Lannister : Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy?

Tommen Lannister : You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years. And you will continue to do so. But not in this city.

Walder : You've lost it?

Black Walder : Yes, father.

Walder : It's a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didn't lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you.

Lothar : He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.

Walder : You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn't find him. That's what it means to lose something. Now he's come back and taken Riverrun.

Black Walder : I don't think it's fair to blame us- -

Walder : For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back.

Black Walder : We don't have the men.

Walder : We've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.

Black Walder : The Mallisters have risen against us. And the Blackwoods.

Lothar : The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps.

Black Walder : Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.

Walder : If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge. They're laughing at us. All across the Riverlands right down to King's Landing, they're laughing at us.

Walder : I hear it in my sleep! I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you. And I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter. Take that castle back.

Lothar : He'll never yield, Father.

Walder : Oh, he'll yield.

Walder : You'll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Stark's child in his whore mother's belly, and you'll show him the knife you used to open his niece's throat. And you'll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place. His nephew.

Walder : Cheer up, Lord Edmure. You're going home.

Jaime Lannister : I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own because he's 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.

Cersei Lannister : BEtter you're elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.

Jaime Lannister : I'm not going to the Riverlands.

Cersei Lannister : What, then?

Jaime Lannister : I'm going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head and every other sparrow head I can find.

Cersei Lannister : You can't.

Jaime Lannister : He has our son! He stole our son! He's torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?

Cersei Lannister : We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can.

Jaime Lannister : You'll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.

Cersei Lannister : It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They've made us both stronger, all of them.

Cersei Lannister : They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we're going to do to them.

Cersei Lannister : We've always been together. We'll always be together. We're the only two people in the world.

Meera : Why did you help us?

Rider : The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.

Meera : The Three-Eyed Raven's dead.

Rider : Now he lives again.

Rider : When I last saw you, you were a boy. A fearless boy. Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother.

Bran Stark : Who are you?

Bran Stark : Uncle Benjen. The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.

Benjen : I led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers. They found us. A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice. Left me there to die. To turn. The Children found me. Stopped the walker's magic from taking hold.

Bran Stark : How?

Benjen : The same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.

Bran Stark : Dragonglass. A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.

Benjen : You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.

Bran Stark : I didn't have time to learn. I can't control anything.

Benjen : You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.

Benjen : Drink.

Benjen : One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men. When he does, you will be there waiting for him. And you will be ready.

Daario : Everything all right?

Daenerys Targaryen : How many days' ride to Meereen?

Daario : A week at best.

Daenerys Targaryen : How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?

Daario : Dothraki and all their horses, the Unsullied, the Second Sons- - 1,000 ships easily. Probably more.

Daenerys Targaryen : And who has that many?

Daario : Nobody.

Daenerys Targaryen : Nobody yet.

Daario : So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?

Daenerys Targaryen : I take what is mine.

Daario : You weren't made to sit on a chair in a palance.

Daenerys Targaryen : What was I made for?

Daario : You're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn.

Daenerys Targaryen : Wait here.

Daario : I'm going after her. Wait for me here.

Daenerys Targaryen : Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.

Daenerys Targaryen : I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?

Daenerys Targaryen : Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?

Daenerys Targaryen : Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?

Daenerys Targaryen : Are you with me?

Daenerys Targaryen : Now and always?

Man : That's it. Get it to the top.

Man : Steady. Steady.

Ray : Up she goes.

Ray : Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?

Ray : Here you are, son.

Ray : Oh, gentlemen, please.

Ray : And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving. Come on, come on.

Ray : In all my days I've never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?

Sandor : Just one.

Ray : Ooh. he must have been some kind of monster.

Sandor : He was a woman.

Ray : I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.

Sandor : I'm used to it.

Ray : When I found you, I thought you'd been dead for days. The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there.

Ray : I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh, nearly shit myself. I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn't. Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn't. What kept you going?

Sandor : Hate.

Ray : No, there's a reason you're still here.

Sandor : Aye, there's a reason. I'm a big fucker and I'm tough to kill.

Ray : No, a reason. Gods aren't done with you yet.

Sandor : I've heard that before. Man was talking about a different god, though.

Ray : Well, maybe he was right. I don't know much about the gods.

Sandor : You're in the wrong line of work.

Ray : Oh, there's plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods. I don't. I don't even know their real names. Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it's the old gods. Or maybe it's the Lord of Light. Or maybe they're all the same fucking thing. I don't know. What matters, I believe, is that there's something greater than us. And whatever it is, it's got plans for Sandor Clegane.

Sandor : You didn't know me back in my time. You don't know the things I've done.

Ray : I've heard stories.

Sandor : If the gods are real...why haven't they punished me?

Ray : They have.

Sparrow : Your Grace. What are we reading today?

Margaery Tyrell : The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness. Chapter three, verse 12.

Sparrow : Ah, "As water rounds the stones, smoothing- "-�

Margaery Tyrell : Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman's love calm a man's brute nature. A wife salves her husbando s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep."�

Sparrow : You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don't have a drop of the Mother's mercy in their blood and savages who can't read at all who understand the Father's wisdom.

Margaery Tyrell : For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me.

Sparrow : They are hard to love.

Sparrow : The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions. They show us what we'd look like without our fine clothes. How'd we smell without perfume.

Sparrow : Can I ask you about a personal matter?

Margaery Tyrell : Of course.

Sparrow : The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven't joined him in the marriage bed.

Margaery Tyrell : No.

Sparrow : You have a duty, Your Grace. To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves.

Margaery Tyrell : It's just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.

Sparrow : Congress does not require desire on the woman's part, only patience. The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work.

Margaery Tyrell : Forgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.

Sparrow : Hard to find and harder still to walk upon. But you've made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.

Margaery Tyrell : My grandmother?

Sparrow : Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul.

Olenna Tyrell : Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.

Margaery Tyrell : Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.

Olenna Tyrell : Oh, this is madness!

Olenna Tyrell : You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about...

Margaery Tyrell : Grandmother.

Olenna Tyrell : until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.

Margaery Tyrell : Grandmother, please.

Olenna Tyrell : What have they done to you?

Margaery Tyrell : You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith.

Olenna Tyrell : We marched for you.

Margaery Tyrell : The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn't. They showed mercy.

Olenna Tyrell : And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?

Margaery Tyrell : Loras's only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He'll have to renounce his name and title...

Olenna Tyrell : Have you lost your mind?

Margaery Tyrell : and live his life as a penitent.

Olenna Tyrell : He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell.

Margaery Tyrell : He can begin again.

Olenna Tyrell : As a mindless fanatic.

Margaery Tyrell : As a free man.

Olenna Tyrell : You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.

Margaery Tyrell : I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.

Margaery Tyrell : But you should leave, Grandmother. Your place is at home.

Olenna Tyrell : I will never leave you. Never.

Margaery Tyrell : You must.

Margaery Tyrell : Go home. Find comfort in prayer and good works.

Margaery Tyrell : The Mother watches over us all.

Olenna Tyrell : I'll see you soon, my dear.

Margaery Tyrell : Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.

Margaery Tyrell : Shall we pray?

Dim Dalba : We said we'd fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn't what we agreed to. These aren't White Walkers. This isn't an army of the dead. This isn't our find.

Tormund : If it weren't for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King's army. And I'd be a pile of charred bones just like Mance.

Dim Dalba : Remember Mance's camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what's left of us. And if we lose this, we're gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We'll be the last of the free folk.

Jon Snow : That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive.

Tormund : The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we're cowards. And if that's what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk.

Wun Wun : Snow.

Jon Snow : Are you sure they'll come?

Tormund : We're not clever like you southerners. When we say we'll do something, we do it.

Cersei Lannister : I heard you were leaving King's Landing.

Olenna Tyrell : That is hardly your concern.

Cersei Lannister : Your grandson is still a prisoner. You'll leave him rotting in a cell?

Olenna Tyrell : Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.

Cersei Lannister : You're right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.

Olenna Tyrell : Good.

Cersei Lannister : I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.

Olenna Tyrell : I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met. At a certain age, it's hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I'll never forget it.

Cersei Lannister : You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It's the only truth I know. We must defend them.

Olenna Tyrell : I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you're half as bright as you think you are, you'll find your way out of here, too.

Cersei Lannister : Never. I'll never leave my son.

Olenna Tyrell : What'll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You're going to kill them all by yourself? You've lost, Cersei. It's the only joy I can find in all this misery.

Man : Pick the pace up. Keep going.

Man : Keep it moving!

Bronn : Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches.

Jaime Lannister : Someone certainly does.

Bronn : Oh, no. Not me. I'm just an upjumped sellsword.

Jaime Lannister : You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.

Bronn : Aye, knights don't get paid.

Jaime Lannister : You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.

Bronn : That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.

Jaime Lannister : I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.

Bronn : You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.

Jaime Lannister : And you'll get all three. A Lannister always- -

Bronn : Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.

Lothar : Come out and fight us, Blackfish. Yield the castle or we'll hang him.

Lothar : This is your last warning. Yield the castle.

Black Walder : You think I won't do it, old man?

Black Walder : I sliced your niece's throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.

Brynden : Go on, then. Cut his throat.

Jaime Lannister : Lothar, is it?

Lothar : Ser Jaime. We didn't know you were coming.

Jaime Lannister : Cause you didn't set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.

Bronn : Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.

Jaime Lannister : Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.

Black Walder : Whoa, whoa.

Lothar : Walder.

Black Walder : Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.

Jaime Lannister : Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out. Now let's say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I'd do?

Black Walder : I don't give a rat's- -

Jaime Lannister : I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you'd like to take his place.

Lothar : Apologies, Ser Jaime.

Lothar : Do as he says.

Jaime Lannister : The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is.

Bronn : Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.

Black Walder : Those are our siege towers- -

Jaime Lannister : As I said, the siege is under my command. If that's not to your liking, go home.

Jaime Lannister : Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.

Bronn : A parley or a fight?

Jaime Lannister : He's an old man.

Bronn : You've got one hand. My money's on the old boy.

Jon Snow : Lady Mormont.

Lyanna : Welcome to Bear Island.

Sansa Stark : I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I'm sure you will be, too.

Lyanna : I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb.

Jon Snow : I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -

Lyanna : I think we've had enough small talk. What are you here?

Jon Snow : Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -

Lyanna : I remember what it said. "Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark."�

Jon Snow : Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance.

Lyanna : As far as I understand, you're a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I've heard conflicting reports.

Sansa Stark : I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.

Lyanna : If you say so. In any case, you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men.

Jon Snow : Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -

Lyanna : I understand that I'm responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else's war?

Davos : If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel.

Lyanna : I don't know you, Ser.?

Davos : Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.

Davos : You needn't ask your maester about my house. It's rather new.

Lyanna : All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?

Davos : You never thought you'd find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I'd be in my position. I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war. It's our war.

Lyanna : Go on, Ser Davos.

Davos : Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses. It's between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming.

Lyanna : Is this true?

Jon Snow : Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.

Davos : As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there's no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together.

Lyanna : House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today.

Jon Snow : Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?

Lyanna : 62

Jon Snow : 62?

Lyanna : We are not a large house, but we're a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.

Davos : If they're half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed.

Brynden : Kingslayer.

Jaime Lannister : Blackfish.

Brynden : I assume you're here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don't see Sansa and Arya.

Jaime Lannister : I don't have them.

Brynden : Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?

Brynden : Then why are you here?

Jaime Lannister : You know why I'm here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You're trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -

Brynden : Or you'll kill Edmure?

Brynden : My nephew's marked for death no matter what. Hang him and be done with it.

Jaime Lannister : It won't stop with Edmure. You'll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.

Brynden : Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours. If you can breach the walls.

Jaime Lannister : We'll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I'll spare the lives of your men. On my honor.

Brynden : Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.

Jaime Lannister : The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?

Brynden : As long as I'm standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I'm ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?

Jaime Lannister : You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives. Why did you come to treat with me?

Brynden : Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you.

Jaime Lannister : Well, now you have.

Brynden : Aye, now I have. I'm disappointed.

Robett : The answer is no.

Jon Snow : Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out.

Robett : I've heard enough. We've only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.

Jon Snow : The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -

Robett : Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?

Jon Snow : House Mormont.

Robett : And?

Jon Snow : We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -

Robett : I don't care about ravens. You're asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?

Jon Snow : The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.

Robett : Then the rumors are true. I didn't dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.

Jon Snow : Lord Glover.

Robett : There's nothing else to say.

Sansa Stark : I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.

Robett : Yes, my family served House Stark for centuries. We wept when we heard of your father's death. When my brother was lord of this castle, he answered Robb's call and hailed him King in the North.

Robett : And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.

Robett : I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead.

Theon Greyjoy : Why did we have to come here?

Yara Greyjoy : Some of us still like it. Have a drink at least.

Theon Greyjoy : I don't want one.

Yara Greyjoy : Don't go far, love.

Yara Greyjoy : I'll find you in a bit.

Yara Greyjoy : Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that. Doesn't interest you anymore?

Yara Greyjoy : I'm sorry. I won't joke about it. I'll never hurt you, little brother. Don't you know that?

Theon Greyjoy : You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?

Yara Greyjoy : Of course he is. As long as we're alive, we're a threat.

Theon Greyjoy : He'll find us.

Yara Greyjoy : It's a great big world and we have fast ships. Drink.

Theon Greyjoy : I don't want any.

Yara Greyjoy : I don't care what you want. Drink.

Yara Greyjoy : Drink it all.

Yara Greyjoy : You're Ironborn, Theon. I know you've had some bad years.

Theon Greyjoy : Some bad years?

Yara Greyjoy : But I'm tired of watching you cower like a beat dog. Drink the goddamn ale.

Yara Greyjoy : Now listen to me. I need you. The real Theon Greyjoy, not this rat shit pretender. Can you find him for me? Drink.

Yara Greyjoy : You escaped, do you hear me? You got away and you're never going back. We'll get justice for you.

Theon Greyjoy : If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell.

Yara Greyjoy : Fuck justice, then. We'll get revenge. Drink.

Yara Greyjoy : Listen to me. If you're so broken that there's no coming back, take a knife and cut your wrists. End it. But if you're staying, Theon, I need you. We're gonna sail to Meereen. We're gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen. And we're gonna take back the Iron Islands.

Yara Greyjoy : Are you with me? Are you really with me?

Yara Greyjoy : Now, since it's my last night ashore for a long while, I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one.

Davos : Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.

Sansa Stark : And that's a good thing?

Davos : He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There's a stream down there for the horses.

Jon Snow : We're not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..

Davos : Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did.

Jon Snow : We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.

Davos : 2,000 Wildlings. 200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins- -

Sansa Stark : 62 Mormonts.

Davos : It's not what we'd hoped for. But we still have a chance if we're careful and smart.

Davos : For fuck's sake.

Sansa Stark : So he's your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?

Jon Snow : Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.

Sansa Stark : Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?

Sansa Stark : It's not enough. We need more men.

Jon Snow : There's no time.

Sansa Stark : If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord- -

Jon Snow : We fight with the army we have.

Davos : Friends, this is not worth fighting over!

Davos : This'll be it, now. Right now, we don't need to be fighting.

Man : Who the fuck are you?

Davos : Hold on.

Man : Yeah, who the fuck are you?

Ray : I was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasn't. I mean, I never ran from a fight. Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That's all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I'm your arsonist. Steal that farmer's crops. Good, I'm your thief. Kill those young lads so they won't take up arms against us. I'm your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren't animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy's throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back.

Ray : That night...I felt such shame. Shame was so heavy on me, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.

Ray : All I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her son's name. I'll hear her screaming the rest of my life.

Ray : Now, I know I can never bring that lad back. All I can do with time I've got left is bring a little goodness into the world. That's all any of us can do, isn't it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people. Start helping people.

Ray : It's never too late to come back.

Ray : And it's not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers. It's not even about the gods. It's about you. Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.

Ray : Seven save you, friends. How can we help you?

Lem : What are you doing here?

Ray : Well, we're talking about life. You?

Lem : Protecting the people.

Ray : Well, we thank you for your protection. Who are you protecting us from?

Lem : Do you have any horses?

Ray : No horses. No gold. No steel.

Lem : Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work.

Ray : I'm sure it is. You're welcome to stay for supper, but we have hungry mouths here.

Lem : Stay safe. The night is dark and full of terrors.

Sandor : Seven save you, friends."�

Ray : I'm a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?

Sandor : They don't believe in your Seven. They're from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.

Ray : Aye, well, all are welcome here. Anyway, we got nothing for them.

Sandor : Sure, you do. You've got food, you've got steel even if you say you don't. And you've got women.

Ray : What do you want to do? Fight them? Kill them?

Ray : It'd be you against all of them. I mean, these people don't know how to fight.

Sandor : You do.

Ray : I'm done with fighting.

Sandor : Even if it's to protect yourself?

Ray : Violence is a disease. You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.

Sandor : You don't cure it by dying, either.

Ray : You've done enough work for one day. Come on up for some supper.

Sandor : It's gonna be a cold night. We'll need firewood.

Ray : I'll save you a bowl of stew. Might even have some ale hidden away.

Man : He's not a lying man. He says the Iron Fleet's in Slaver's Bay. I'm inclined to believe him. I'm not going anywhere near those mad fuckers.

Arya Stark : You're Westerosi.

Man : What do you care?

Arya Stark : I want to book passage home.

Man : You? Can't afford it.

Man : Where'd you steal this from?

Arya Stark : Why do you care?

Man : We leave in two days. You can have a hammock in steerage.

Arya Stark : I want a cabin. And we'll leave at dawn.

Arya Stark : See you at sunrise.

Woman : Sweet girl.

Lady Crane : My son. My firstborn son. My child king, hush. Listen to the gods, for you they sing. Fight no more, sweet child. Your wars are won. The wolves are buried and the false stag done. Shut your blue eyes, my love. Let the crown fall. The Father above beckons you into his hall. In Seventh Heaven I'll see you once more. But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king. Born amongst lions, our curse from within. I will slay him, I swear. With noose or with knife, though it take me a fortnight, a moon, or my life.

Arya Stark : You're good at that. Where did you learn?

Lady Crane : I'm a jealous woman. I've always liked bad men and they've always liked me. They'd come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whore's perfume.

Lady Crane : So we'd fight and I'd put a hole in them. And then I'd feel terrible, so I'd patch them up. I got good at patching them up.

Arya Stark : And good at putting holes in them.

Lady Crane : And that.

Arya Stark : What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.

Lady Crane : Bianca.

Lady Crane : She'll have a hard time finding work as an actress after what I did to her face.

Arya Stark : Mmm.

Lady Crane : I never did learn to cook. But eat. Eat. You need it. The company is moving on to Pentos soon. You should come with us.

Arya Stark : I can't.

Lady Crane : Why not? Got a feeling you'd be good at this sort of work. And besides, we need a new actress.

Arya Stark : I don't think I could remember all of the lines.

Lady Crane : Come with us. What's left for you here?

Arya Stark : You wouldn't be safe. Not while she's looking for me.

Lady Crane : Who?

Arya Stark : She doesn't have a name.

Lady Crane : Where will you go?

Arya Stark : Essos is east and Westeros is west. But what's west of Westeros?

Lady Crane : I don't know.

Arya Stark : Nobody does. That's where all the maps stop.

Lady Crane : The edge of the world, maybe.

Arya Stark : I'd like to see that.

Arya Stark : What's that?

Lady Crane : Milk of the poppy.

Arya Stark : I don't want any.

Lady Crane : Sleep is the only way you'll heal. Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will.

Man : Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.

Gatins : I was a famous kisser. You lads know how to kiss proper?

Young Man : Course we do.

Gatins : This is for masters, this technique. You're not ready.

Young Man : I'm ready.

Man : He says he's ready.

Gatins : All right.

Gatins : Now, pay attention. You put your left hand on the back of the lady's head.

Gatins : Your right hand holds the small of the lady's back like so.

Gatins : Very romantic. Take your middle finger, yeah, and you jam it right up her bunghole.

Man : So fucking close!

Gatins : Ah, it smells like pussy to me.

Man : Look at him. You get hard, boy?

Young Man : Fuck you! Disgusting old twats.

Young Man : Got off on that, did you, you old fuck?

Sandor : Where's the other one? The one with the yellow cloak.

Gatins : Fuck you!

Sandor : Those are your last words, fuck you? Come on, you can do better.

Gatins : Cunt!

Sandor : You're shit at dying, you know that?

Red Priestess : From the fire she was reborn to remake the world. Daenerys is a gift from the Lord of Light to her children. If we are steadfast in our love for the Queen and her faithful advisors, no man will ever lock us in chains again.

Tyrion Lannister : I'd call that a successful gambit.

Varys : Would you?

Tyrion Lannister : Look around. The city has come back to life.

Varys : You made a pact with fanatics.

Tyrion Lannister : I did and it worked.

Varys : If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked. That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat.

Tyrion Lannister : Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm going to miss you.

Varys : I know.

Tyrion Lannister : I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.

Varys : If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong.

Varys : We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.

Tyrion Lannister : Most of all, we need our queen.

Varys : She'll come back. She has to. My heart's been broken too many times already.

Varys : I'll walk the rest of the way myself. I can't go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.

Tyrion Lannister : Varys.

Tyrion Lannister : The most famous dwarf in the world.

Qyburn : Your Grace, several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep.

Cersei Lannister : Have been permitted? That's rather a tortured way of putting it.

Qyburn : They demand to see you, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?

Cersei Lannister : The king is aware of their presence?

Qyburn : He is, Your Grace. He's currently in his chambers at prayer.

Lancel : Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor.

Cersei Lannister : His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.

Lancel : Your Grace, this is not a request.

Cersei Lannister : It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I'm refusing.

Lancel : The High Septon commands you. Are you sure you want to refuse him?

Cersei Lannister : He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.

Lancel : He made no such promises. If you refuse to come of your own free will- -

Cersei Lannister : Get out.

Lancel : Move aside, ser.

Lancel : Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.

Cersei Lannister : I choose violence.

Cersei Lannister : Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.

Podrick : Looks like a siege, my lady.

Brienne : You have a keen military mind, Pod.

Podrick : My lady. My lady.

Man : Who goes there? State your business!

Brienne : My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.

Bronn : Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?

Bronn : Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you'd be dead by now.

Podrick : Not yet.

Bronn : Are they in there?

Podrick : Mm-hmm.

Bronn : You think they're fucking?

Podrick : What? No.

Bronn : Why not? I'd fuck her. You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?

Podrick : I'm her squire.

Bronn : Oh. Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure. And she's fuck him, don't you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you're the one with the magic cock.

Bronn : You must have shown it to her by now.

Podrick : She's training me to fight.

Bronn : Is she? Oh.

Podrick : An hour in the morning, and hour at night. Every day.

Bronn : Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?

Podrick : Well, that's a different sort of fighting.

Bronn : Now, that's the truth, isn't it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?

Bronn : All right, let's start with your footwork.

Bronn : Show me your stance.

Bronn : Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?

Bronn : Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. 'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don't sulk.

Jaime Lannister : I never thought you'd find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.

Brienne : Why would you assume that?

Jaime Lannister : In my experience, girls like her don't live very long.

Brienne : I don't think you know many girls like her.

Jaime Lannister : Well, I'm proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds.

Jaime Lannister : Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?

Brienne : I've come for the Blackfish.

Jaime Lannister : You're welcome to have him.

Brienne : Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.

Jaime Lannister : With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?

Brienne : The Tully army.

Jaime Lannister : They're a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum.

Brienne : The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?

Jaime Lannister : Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.

Brienne : As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.

Jaime Lannister : Exactly.

Jaime Lannister : We shouldn't argue about politics.

Brienne : You're a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I've seen it myself.

Jaime Lannister : I'm a Lannister. Don't ask me to betray my own house.

Brienne : I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.

Jaime Lannister : What do you propose?

Brienne : Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.

Jaime Lannister : Why would he abandon his ancestral home?

Brienne : Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.

Jaime Lannister : Have you ever met the Blackfish?

Brienne : No.

Jaime Lannister : He's even more stubborn than you are.

Jaime Lannister : All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won't listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home.

Brienne : I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant us safe passage north.

Jaime Lannister : You have my word. You have until nightfall.

Brienne : You gave it to me for a purpose. I've achieved that purpose.

Jaime Lannister : It's yours. It will always be yours.

Brienne : one last thing, Ser Jaime.

Jaime Lannister : Yes, Lady Brienne?

Brienne : Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin.

Jaime Lannister : Of course it does.

Brienne : To fight you.

Jaime Lannister : Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

Brynden : I've said no three times already.

Brienne : I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.

Brynden : I haven't seen her since she was a child. I don't know her signature. I don't know you. And I will not surrender.

Brynden : Double the guards tonight.

Bryndel : The Kingslayer wants to try us. I can feel it.

Brienne : As I have said, my name is- -

Brynden : Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father. A good man.

Brienne : He always spoke highly of you.

Brynden : And if he were here now, I'd tell him the same I'm telling you.

Brynden : If you think I'm abandoning my family's seat on the Kingslayer's word of honor, you're a bloody fool.

Brienne : Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.

Brynden : We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.

Brienne : He's not my friend.

Brynden : No?

Brynden : Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?

Brienne : Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die.

Brynden : She's exactly like her mother.

Brynden : I don't have enough men to help her take Winterfell.

Brienne : You have more than she does.

Brynden : She wants her home back. I understand that. But this is my home. And if Jaime Lannister wants it, he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does.

Brienne : Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.

Podrick : What should I write?

Brienne : Tell her I failed.

Cersei Lannister : There's to be a royal announcement?

Kevan : There is.

Cersei Lannister : Why wasn't I informed?

Kevan : There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment.

Kevan : Where are you going?

Cersei Lannister : To stand by my son.

Kevan : Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.

Tommen Lannister : Lords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses, so does the other. The Father judges us all. If you break his laws...you will be punished. After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister's trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother.

Tommen Lannister : Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms. The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods. Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. Seven blessings to all.

Crowd : Seven blessings.

Qyburn : Your Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.

Cersei Lannister : And? Was it just a rumor or something more?

Qyburn : More. Much more.

Missandei : You seem happy.

Tyrion Lannister : I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself.

Tyrion Lannister : Now it's like a man reborn.

Missandei : I will be happy when our queen returns.

Tyrion Lannister : Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?

Grey Worm : Unsullied never drink.

Tyrion Lannister : Why not?

Grey Worm : Rules.

Tyrion Lannister : And who made these rules? Your former masters?

Tyrion Lannister : Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human. Have a drink with me.

Tyrion Lannister : And you? What's your excuse?

Missandei : I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.

Tyrion Lannister : That's how you know it's working.

Tyrion Lannister : Here's to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.

Tyrion Lannister : To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign.

Grey Worm : Long may she reign.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you like it?

Grey Worm : Tastes like it has turned.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I'd like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp's Delight. Only my close friends could drink it.

Tyrion Lannister : Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.

Missandei : I do not know any jokes.

Tyrion Lannister : Grey worm?

Tyrion Lannister : Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale...

Tyrion Lannister : but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, "Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out."�

Tyrion Lannister : It's funnier in Westeros.

Grey Worm : The Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes.

Missandei : A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho. Not a true story, necessarily.

Tyrion Lannister : A story that's supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps.

Tyrion Lannister : Missandei, do you like the wine?

Missandei : I do.

Tyrion Lannister : Tell a joke.

Missandei : Two translators are on a sinking ship.

Missandei : The first says, "Do you know how to swim?"� The second says, "No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages."�

Tyrion Lannister : Ah!

Grey Worm : That is the worst joke I ever heard.

Missandei : You don't even know what a joke is.

Grey Worm : I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?

Tyrion Lannister : You lied to us.

Grey Worm : I make joke.

Missandei : More jokes.

Tyrion Lannister : I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -

Missandei : The Masters have come for their property.

Jaime Lannister : Lord Edmure.

Jaime Lannister : I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothes from now on.

Edmure : I have your word?

Edmure : Oh, good. Good, that's- - that's a fine thing. My uncle will never surrender the castle, ser. Whatever game you're playing.

Jaime Lannister : The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I've heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You're a potent man.

Edmure : A son I've never met born of a wife that I haven't seen since our first night together.

Jaime Lannister : You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own.

Edmure : Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you've massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.

Jaime Lannister : I'll remind you that our houses are at war. I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences.

Edmure : Says the man who shoved his sword through his king's back.

Jaime Lannister : Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It's not.

Edmure : You understand. On some level you understand that you're an evil man.

Jaime Lannister : I'll leave the judgments to the gods.

Edmure : Well, that is convenient for you. You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?

Edmure : Your square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we're decent, don't we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you're decent after everything that you've done?

Jaime Lannister : I was your sister's prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.

Edmure : Yeah. She should have killed you.

Jaime Lannister : Perhaps, but she didn't. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn't hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son.

Edmure : Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don't?

Jaime Lannister : No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner. You don't have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister.

Edmure : Oh. Oh, I see. You're a madman.

Jaime Lannister : I'm not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong- -

Edmure : Don't talk about Cat!

Jaime Lannister : I'll talk about whomever I want.

Jaime Lannister : She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there's a fierceness you don't often see.

Jaime Lannister : They'd do anything to protect their babies.

Jaime Lannister : Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.

Edmure : You didn't come here to talk about our sisters.

Jaime Lannister : That's exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn't matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I'll send for your baby boy.

Jaime Lannister : And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn't matter to me. The people in the castle don't matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that's what I'll do.

Guard Captain : Who goes there?

Edmure : Edmure Tully, son of Hoster Tully, and the rightful Lord of Riverrun. I demand entry.

Brynden : Don't let him in.

Guard Captain : He's the Lord of Riverrun. I have to obey his commands.

Brynden : He's been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding. Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home? Because it's a trap, you idiot. Don't let him in.

Guard Captain : He's my lord, my lord. I've sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands.

Brynden : You're not obeying Edmure's commands. You're obeying the fucking Kinglsayer's commands.

Edmure : I demand entry.

Guard Captain : My lord has given an order.

Brynden : WIth a knife to his throat. That is not a valid order.

Guard Captain : Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed- -

Brynden : I'll have your head before I surrender Riverrun.

Guard Captain : You are not lord of this castle, my lord.

Guard Captain : Lower the drawbridge!

Guard : Aye, ser!

Black Walder : If you're wrong, we're just surrendered our most valuable prisoner.

Guard Captain : Welcome home, my lord.

Edmure : Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms. Open the gates.

Guard Captain : My lord- -

Edmure : Your lord has given a command.

Edmure : Find the Blackfish. Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys.

Guard Captain : Find him.

Brynden : Go on.

Brienne : Come with us.

Brynden : I've run before from the Red Wedding. I'm not running again. This is my family home.

Brienne : Your family is in the North. Come with us. Don't die for pride when you can fight for your blood.

Brynden : You'll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.

Brynden : Go on, now.

Brynden : I haven't had a proper sword fight in years. I expect I'll make a damn fool of myself.

Guard : We found the Blackfish, my lord.

Jaime Lannister : Good. Bring him to me.

Guard : He died fighting, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : I was wrong. I admit it.

Missandei : That changes nothing.

Tyrion Lannister : The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers' forces- -

Grey Worm : No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.

Tyrion Lannister : And I have acknowledged that. I'm trying- -

Grey Worm : You're trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.

Tyrion Lannister : All right, what should the army do?

Grey Worm : We'll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here.

Tyrion Lannister : And then?

Grey Worm : We wait for them to come to us. Then we fight them.

Beric : Clegane.

Thoros : What the fuck you doing here?

Sandor : Chasing them. You?

Thoros : Hanging them.

Sandor : Any particular reason?

Beric : They're our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?

Sandor : Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.

Thoros : You've got friends?

Sandor : Not anymore. They're mine.

Beric : It's the Brotherhoodo s good name they've dragged through the dirt.

Sandor : Fuck your name. They're mine. I killed you once before, Dondarrion. Happy to do it again.

Sandor : Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.

Sandor : Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.

Beric : You can have one of them.

Sandor : Two.

Thoros : No, no, no.

Thoros : We're not butchers. We hang them.

Sandor : hanging? All over in an instant. Where's the punishment in that?

Thoros : They die.

Sandor : We all bloody die.

Sandor : Except this one here. I'll only gut one of them.

Beric : No.

Sandor : I'll chop off one hand.

Beric : We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. That's generous.

Sandor : Bunch of nancies.

Sandor : There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.

Thoros : You're getting old, Clegane.

Sandor : He's not.

Lem : Please don't. I'll give you anything.

Sandor : Got anything to eat?

Thoros : Enjoying yourself?

Sandor : I prefer chicken.

Beric : You ought to join us. We could use you.

Sandor : I tried joining. Didn't work out for me.

Thoros : Clegane, we're here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves.

Sandor : Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.

Beric : Cold winds are rising in the North.

Sandor : And you're going to go stop them?

Beric : We need good men to help us.

Sandor : Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me.

Beric : True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?

Sandor : I beat you because I'm better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I'm better than you now.

Beric : Aye, you're probably right. You're a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we're fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you've harmed Clegane, it's not too late for you.

Arya Stark : Lady Crane?

Waif : If you'd have done your job, she would have died painlessly.

Waif : Instead.

Waif : The Many-Faced God was promised a name. He must always receive what is his. You can't change that. I can't change that. No one can. And now he's been promised another name.

Waif : It will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet?

Waif : Haven't we been through this already? That won't help you.

Arya Stark : You told her to kill me.

Jaqen Hghar : Yes. But here you are. And there she is.

Jaqen Hghar : Finally a girl is no one.

Arya Stark : A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I'm going home.

Tyrion Lannister : Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise.

Tyrion Lannister : Perhaps we should take shelter.

Daenerys Targaryen : The city is on the rise?

Tyrion Lannister : Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters.

Tyrion Lannister : it proves that no one needs a Master.

Daenerys Targaryen : Good. Shall we begin?

Tyrion Lannister : Do we have a plan?

Daenerys Targaryen : I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan.

Daenerys Targaryen : You don't approve?

Tyrion Lannister : You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?

Tyrion Lannister : Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That's why Jaime killed him.

Daenerys Targaryen : This is entirely different.

Tyrion Lannister : You're talking about destroying cities. It's not entirely different. I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.

Razdal : Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver's Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are.

Tyrion Lannister : We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.

Yezzan : The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.

Daenerys Targaryen : We obviously didn't communicate clearly. We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine.

Razdal : I imagine it's difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.

Daenerys Targaryen : My reign has just begun.

Daenerys Targaryen : Dracarys.

Grey Worm : You men have a choice

Grey Worm : fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families.

Tyrion Lannister : Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.

Missandei : Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.

Tyrion Lannister : It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it, other people dying?

Razdal : Him. He should die.

Belicho : Yes, him.

Razdal : He's not one of us. He's an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us.

Yezzan : Please.

Tyrion Lannister : Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.

Jon Snow : You don't have to be here.

Sansa Stark : Yes, I do.

Ramsay Bolton : My beloved wife. I've missed you terribly.

Ramsay Bolton : Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don't have the men, you don't have the horses, and you don't have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There's no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I'm a man of mercy.

Jon Snow : You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me.

Ramsay Bolton : I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don't know if I'd beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?

Jon Snow : Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?

Ramsay Bolton : He's good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you're too proud to surrender?

Sansa Stark : How do we know you have him?

Ramsay Bolton : Now, if you want to save "?

Sansa Stark : You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well.

Ramsay Bolton : She's a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you're all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven't fed them for seven days. They're ravenous. I wonder which parts they'll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We'll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard.

Jon Snow : If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.

Davos : That's not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they'll stop fearing him. He can't have that. Fear is his power.

Jon Snow : It's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning...

Tormund : It's not his men that worry me. It's his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.

Tormund : You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.

Jon Snow : We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment.

Tormund : stares blankly at JON SNOW.

Jon Snow : A pincer move.

Jon Snow : They won't be able to hit us from the sides.

Tormund : Good.

Davos : It's crucial that we let them charge at us. They've got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue. Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides.

Tormund : Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?

Jon Snow : No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.

Davos : We should all get some sleep.

Tormund : Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow.

Sansa Stark : So you've met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans.

Jon Snow : Aye, for what they're worth.

Sansa Stark : You've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?

Jon Snow : You're right.

Sansa Stark : You think he's going to fall into your trap. He won't He's the one who lays traps.

Jon Snow : He's overconfident.

Sansa Stark : He plays with people. He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.

Jon Snow : Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

Sansa Stark : You don't know him.

Jon Snow : All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?

Sansa Stark : We'll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long.

Jon Snow : We can't give up on our brother.

Sansa Stark : Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake.

Jon Snow : Of course he does. What should I do differently?

Sansa Stark : I don't know! I don't know anything about battles! Just don't do what he wants you to do.

Jon Snow : Aye, that's good advice.

Sansa Stark : You think that's obvious?

Jon Snow : Well, it is a bit obvious.

Sansa Stark : If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?

Jon Snow : When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men!

Sansa Stark : It's not enough!

Jon Snow : Now, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds.

Sansa Stark : If Ramsay wins, I'm not going back there alive. Do you understand me?

Jon Snow : SNOW I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise.

Sansa Stark : No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.

Davos : You think there's hope?

Tormund : I've never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they've never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there's hope. You want to avenge your king, don't you?

Davos : It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.

Tormund : You saw these demons?

Davos : What?

Davos : No, it's a manner of speaking. Not actual demons.

Tormund : Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn't have demons in his skull. He didn't torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you.

Davos : Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings.

Tormund : Jon Snow's not a king.

Davos : No, he's not.

Tormund : I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat's milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.

Davos : No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle.

Tormund : So what do you do all night?

Davos : I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.

Tormund : Happy shitting.

Jon Snow : My lady. You weren't at the war council.

Melisandre : I'm not a soldier.

Jon Snow : Any advice?

Melisandre : Don't lose.

Jon Snow : If I do, if I fall, don't bring me back.

Melisandre : I'll have to try.

Jon Snow : I'm ordering you not to bring me back.

Melisandre : I am not your servant, Jon Snow.

Jon Snow : You're in my camp. I'm the commander.

Melisandre : I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.

Jon Snow : How do you know what he commands?

Melisandre : I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you.

Jon Snow : Why?

Melisandre : I don't know. Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.

Jon Snow : What kind of god would do something like that?

Melisandre : The one we've got.

Tyrion Lannister : Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. "The height of nobility,"� "a man of your stature,"� "someone to look up to."� You're all making the same five or six jokes.

Theon Greyjoy : It was a long time ago.

Tyrion Lannister : It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.

Theon Greyjoy : I didn't murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.

Yara Greyjoy : And he paid for them.

Tyrion Lannister : Doesn't seem like it. He's still alive. It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?

Daenerys Targaryen : You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?

Theon Greyjoy : Not my claim. Hers.

Daenerys Targaryen : And what's wrong with you?

Theon Greyjoy : I'm not fit to rule.

Tyrion Lannister : We can agree upon that at least.

Daenerys Targaryen : Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?

Yara Greyjoy : No more than Westeros.

Theon Greyjoy : Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.

Daenerys Targaryen : Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.

Yara Greyjoy : You and I have that in common.

Daenerys Targaryen : We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.

Daenerys Targaryen : Will their ships be enough?

Tyrion Lannister : With the former Masters' fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.

Theon Greyjoy : There are and Euron is building more. He's going to offer them to you.

Daenerys Targaryen : So why shouldn't I wait for him?

Theon Greyjoy : The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing. He also wants to give you --

Yara Greyjoy : His big cock, I think he said. Euron's offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won't get one without the other.

Daenerys Targaryen : And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?

Yara Greyjoy : I never demand, but I'm up for anything, really.

Theon Greyjoy : He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.

Tyrion Lannister : The Seven Kingdoms.

Theon Greyjoy : All of them.

Daenerys Targaryen : And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?

Theon Greyjoy : Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.

Daenerys Targaryen : And that's all?

Yara Greyjoy : We'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don't think a woman's fit to rule.

Daenerys Targaryen : Reasonable.

Tyrion Lannister : What if everyone starts demanding their independence?

Daenerys Targaryen : She's not demanding, she's asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We're not going to do that. We're going to leave the world better than we found it.

Daenerys Targaryen : You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping.

Yara Greyjoy : That's our way of life.

Daenerys Targaryen : No more.

Yara Greyjoy : No more.

Ramsay Bolton : Do you like games, little man? Let's play a game. Run to your brother. The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him. That's it. That's the game. Easy. Ready? Go.

Ramsay Bolton : No, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules.

Tormund : Don't.

Davos : Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge!

Davos : Go! Go! Follow your commander!

Tormund : Run and fight!

Ramsay Bolton : Now.

Karstark : Cavalry, charge!

Davos : We'll just kill our own men. Stand down.

Ramsay Bolton : Loose!

Jon Snow : Get word --

Davos : We may as well be taking shits back here.

Davos : Follow!

Ramsay Bolton : It's time, go.

Smalljon : Who owns the North?

All : We do!

Smalljon : Show me!

Tormund : Hey!

Man : Infantry, advance!

Davos : With me, lads! Break their line!

Man : Tormund!

Man : Get him back!

Tormund : Fuck this, come on!

Ramsay Bolton : Their army's gone.

Man : Our army's gone.

Ramsay Bolton : We have Winterfell. They don't have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.

Ramsay Bolton : You suggested one on one combat, didn't you?

Ramsay Bolton : I've reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.

Jon Snow : We're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.

Sansa Stark : Jon.

Sansa Stark : Where is he?

Ramsay Bolton : Ah. Sansa. Hello, Sansa. Is this where I'll be staying now? No. Our time together is about to come to an end. That's all right. You can't kill me. I'm part of you now.

Sansa Stark : Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.

Ramsay Bolton : My hounds will never harm me.

Sansa Stark : You haven't fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.

Ramsay Bolton : They're loyal beasts.

Sansa Stark : They were. Now they're starving.

Ramsay Bolton : Sit. Down! Down! Down! Down! Down!

Attendant : Your Grace. The trial will be getting underway soon.

Mistress : You got my money?

Pycelle : Later. Go away.

Girl : Grand Maester.

Sparrow : Ser Loras Tyrell. Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?

Loras : There'll be no need for a trial. I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.

Sparrow : To which crimes will you be confessing?

Loras : All of them. I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon.

Loras : I perjured myself before the gods. I am guilty of depravity. dishonesty, profligacy, and arrogance. I see that now. I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just.

Sparrow : The gods' judgment is fierce, but also fair. The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice. But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her.

Loras : I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires. My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven. May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.

Sparrow : You understand fully what this means?

Loras : I do. I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it. I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden. I will never marry and I will never father children.

Sparrow : Brother Loras.

Sparrow : I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods.

Sparrow : Will you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates?

Loras : I will.

Mace : No, I can't let them.

Margaery Tyrell : Faith is the way, Father.

Tommen Lannister : All right. I'm ready.

Tommen Lannister : I have to go, I'm-- I'm late for the trial.

Margaery Tyrell : You mutilated him. You gave me your word.

Sparrow : I've kept my word. Once the queen mother's trial is concluded, Brother Loras is free to leave.

Margaery Tyrell : And where is the queen mother?

Lancel : Her litter never left the Red Keep.

Sparrow : It appears the queen mother doesn't wish to attend her own trial.

Sparrow : Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.

Lancel : Get the others.

Pycelle : Where's the king?

Qyburn : Elsewhere, I'm afraid.

Pycelle : What's the meaning of this? I was told that-- I have more important things to do with my time than waste them in the presence--

Qyburn : Please, Grand Maester. I bear you no ill will. Please forgive me if you can.

Qyburn : This pains me, my lord. Whatever your faults, you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold, dark place. But sometimes before we can usher in the new, the old must be put to rest.

Lancel : The longer you wait, the worse it'll be for you.

Lancel : What are you doing?

Margaery Tyrell : There's something wrong.

Sparrow : You have nothing to fear, Your Grace. The trial will begin shortly.

Margaery Tyrell : Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here. Why do you think they are not here?

Sparrow : If the accused is not here, she will be tried regardless. We cannot escape the justice of the gods--

Margaery Tyrell : Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what I'm telling you. Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway, which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences. The trial can wait. We all need to leave.

Margaery Tyrell : We all need to leave now!

Margaery Tyrell : Loras. Stay with me.

Margaery Tyrell : Let me through. Let me through. Get out of my way.

Margaery Tyrell : Let us through!

Cersei Lannister : Confess. Confess.

Septa Unella : No.

Cersei Lannister : Confess.

Cersei Lannister : Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother. because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow. and all his little sparrows. all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances.

Cersei Lannister : You've always been quiet.

Cersei Lannister : I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?

Septa Unella : Good. I'm glad to see your face. I'm ready to meet the gods.

Cersei Lannister : What? Now? Today? You're not going to die today. You're not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor.

Cersei Lannister : This is Ser Gregor Clegane. He's quiet, too.

Cersei Lannister : Your gods have forsaken you. This is your god now.

Cersei Lannister : Shame.

Attendant : I'm very sorry, Your Grace. Very sorry.

Walder : For House Lannister!

Men : Hear me roar!

Walder : For House Frey!

Men : We stand together!

Walder : May we stand together through the centuries, good friends to the last.

Walder : And when we drive our swords through our enemies' hearts, may we speak the words of our alliance, "The Freys and the Lannisters send their regards."�

Bronn : You don't even have to do anything, do you?

Bronn : You just sit there, a rich slab of beef, and all the birds come pecking.

Jaime Lannister : You're welcome to her.

Bronn : She doesn't want me. She wants your golden fingers up her twat.

Jaime Lannister : Those two have their eyes on you.

Bronn : They have their eyes on you, cunt.

Jaime Lannister : Not my type.

Bronn : Not blonde enough?

Jaime Lannister : Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

Jaime Lannister : There you go.

Bronn : Maybe I'm not in the mood.

Bronn : Fuck it.

Bronn : No need to call me ser just because I'm an anointed knight.

Walder : This came together rather well. Your father would be pleased.

Jaime Lannister : I'm sure he would be.

Walder : Edmure is back in a cell. Can't go killing my son by law. It wouldn't be right. Give the family a bad name.

Walder : So the famous Blackfish killed by footsoldiers, eh? Legendary warrior, everyone said.

Jaime Lannister : Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?

Walder : I'm a bit old for all that.

Jaime Lannister : No, but back in your day.

Walder : The purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies, isn't it?

Walder : I've defeated mine. Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years. Now it's mine. What do you call that? Victory.

Jaime Lannister : Yes, you're a great conqueror.

Walder : Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind? The Tullys mocked me for years. The Starks mocked me. Where are they now? You talk about war as if you're an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting, you were captured by Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. But it doesn't matter. Here we are now, two kingslayers. We know what it's like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs. We don't mind, do we? Fear is a marvelous thing.

Jaime Lannister : They don't fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?

Cersei Lannister : Show me.

Qyburn : Your Grace, there's no need--

Qyburn : What are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral? As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option, perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?

Cersei Lannister : He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.

Sam : Hello.

Sam : From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.

Sam : I'm-- I'm to be the new maester.

Maester : Oh.

Maester : According to our records, Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.

Sam : He died.

Maester : We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.

Sam : Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. He's since passed away. Which is why I'm here.

Maester : This is irregular.

Sam : Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular.

Maester : The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you. In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library. Follow me.

Maester : No women or children!

Jon Snow : When we had feasts, our family would sit up here. and I'd sit down there.

Melisandre : Could have been worse, Jon Snow. You had a family. You had feasts.

Jon Snow : Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most.

Jon Snow : What is that?

Davos : Tell him. Tell him who it belonged to.

Melisandre : The Princess Shireen.

Davos : Tell him what you did to her. Tell him!

Melisandre : We burned her at the stake.

Davos : Why?

Melisandre : The army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.

Davos : You burned a little girl alive!

Melisandre : I only do what my Lord commands!

Davos : If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!

Melisandre : We are standing here because of him. Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.

Davos : I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!

Melisandre : So did her father. So did her mother. Her own blood knew it was the only way.

Davos : The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied.

Melisandre : I didn't lie. I was wrong.

Davos : Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?

Davos : I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.

Jon Snow : Do you have anything to say for yourself?

Melisandre : I've been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he's not. You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war.

Jon Snow : Ride south today. If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer.

Davos : If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself.

Jon Snow : I'm having the lordo s chamber prepared for you.

Sansa Stark : Mother and Father's room? You should take it.

Jon Snow : I'm not a Stark.

Sansa Stark : You are to me.

Jon Snow : You're the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We're standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.

Sansa Stark : He did.

Jon Snow : And you trust him?

Sansa Stark : Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I'm sorry.

Jon Snow : We need to trust each other. We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.

Sansa Stark : Jon.

Sansa Stark : A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.

Jon Snow : Well, Father always promised, didn't he?

Olenna Tyrell : The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?

Ellaria : You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna.

Olenna Tyrell : You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?

Obara : We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help. You came to Dorne because you needed our help?

Olenna Tyrell : What is your name again? Barbaro?

Obara : Obara.

Olenna Tyrell : Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Don't presume to tell me what I need.

Nymeria : Forgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes--

Olenna Tyrell : Do shut up, dear.

Olenna Tyrell : Anything from you?

Olenna Tyrell : No? Good. Let the grown women speak.

Ellaria : The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.

Olenna Tyrell : Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I'm after now.

Ellaria : You're absolutely right. I chose the wrong words. It is not survival I offer. It is your heart's desire.

Olenna Tyrell : And what is my heart's desire?

Ellaria : Vengeance. Justice.

Varys : Fire and blood.

Daario : Your ships are nearly ready. I saw them painting the sails.

Daario : I'm curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.

Daenerys Targaryen : You're not coming with us.

Daario : New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King's Landing.

Daenerys Targaryen : You're not going to Westeros. You're staying here with the Second Sons. There's finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.

Daario : Fuck Meereen. Fuck the people. I'm here for you, not them.

Daenerys Targaryen : You promised me. "My sword is yours. My life is yours."� This is what I command. If I'm going to rule in Westeros, I'll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage.

Daario : Who are you marrying this time?

Daenerys Targaryen : I don't know. Maybe no one.

Daario : But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?

Daenerys Targaryen : I can't bring a lover to Westeros.

Daario : A king wouldn't think twice about it.

Daenerys Targaryen : So that's what you want? To be my mistress?

Daario : I'm not proud. I don't care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I don't want a crown. I want you.

Daario : I love you. And I make you happy. You know I do. Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.

Daenerys Targaryen : I can't.

Daario : The dwarf told you to do this.

Daenerys Targaryen : No one tells me to do anything.

Daario : Clever fellow. Can't argue with his logic. I'm no use to you over there.

Daenerys Targaryen : Don't get angry.

Daario : I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?

Daenerys Targaryen : A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons.

Daario : Bay of Dragons?

Daenerys Targaryen : We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?

Daario : You'll get that throne you want so badly, I'm sure of it. I hope it brings you happiness.

Daario : I pity the lord of Westeros. They have no idea what's coming for them.

Daenerys Targaryen : Farewell, Daario Naharis.

Tyrion Lannister : How did he take it?

Daenerys Targaryen : No tears.

Tyrion Lannister : I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That's the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it's any consolation.

Daenerys Targaryen : It's not.

Tyrion Lannister : No, I suppose not. I'm terrible at consoling.

Daenerys Targaryen : Yes, you really are.

Tyrion Lannister : All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It's all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?

Tyrion Lannister : Good. You're in the great game now. And the great game's terrifying. The only people who aren't afraid of failure are madmen like your father.

Daenerys Targaryen : Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.

Tyrion Lannister : He wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last.

Daenerys Targaryen : Well, you have completely failed to console me.

Tyrion Lannister : For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone's always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am.

Tyrion Lannister : I believe in you. It's embarrassing, really. I'd swear you my sword, but I don't actually own a sword.

Daenerys Targaryen : It's your counsel I need.

Tyrion Lannister : It's yours. Now and always.

Daenerys Targaryen : Good. I, um. I had something made for you. I'm not sure if it's right.

Daenerys Targaryen : Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen.

Walder : You're not one of mine, are you?

Handmaiden : No, my lord.

Walder : Didn't think so. Too pretty.

Walder : Where are my damn moron sons? Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.

Handmaiden : They're here, my lord.

Walder : Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs? Tell them to come here now.

Handmaiden : But they're already here, my lord.

Handmaiden : Here, my lord.

Handmaiden : They weren't easy to carve. Especially Black Walder.

Walder : What.

Arya Stark : My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you're ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.

Petyr : Forgive me, my lady. if you're at prayer.

Sansa Stark : I'm done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had.

Sansa Stark : I was a stupid girl.

Petyr : You were a child.

Sansa Stark : What do you want?

Petyr : I thought you knew what I wanted.

Sansa Stark : I was wrong.

Petyr : No, you weren't. Every time I'm faced with a decision, I close my eyes and see the same picture. Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality? Pull it out of my mind and into the world? And I only act if the answer is yes. A picture of me on the Iron Throne. and you by my side.

Sansa Stark : It's a pretty picture.

Petyr : News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms. I've declared for House Stark for all to hear.

Sansa Stark : You've declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish. It's never stopped you from serving yourself.

Petyr : The past is gone for good. You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future. You, my love, are the future of House Stark. Who should the North rally behind? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?

Benjen : This is where I leave you.

Meera : You're not coming with us?

Benjen : The Wall is not just ice and stone. Ancient spells were carved into its foundations. Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond. And while it stands, the dead cannot pass. I cannot pass.

Meera : Where will you go?

Benjen : The great war is coming and I still fight for the living. I'll do what I can. as long as I can.

Bran Stark : Thank you, Uncle Benjen.

Benjen : I wish you both good fortune.

Meera : Are you sure you're ready for this?

Bran Stark : I'm the Three-Eyed Raven now. I have to be ready for this.

Lyanna : Ned?

Eddard Stark : Lyanna.

Lyanna : Is that you? Is that really you?

Lyanna : You're not a dream.

Eddard Stark : No, I'm not a dream. I'm here. Right here.

Lyanna : I've missed you, big brother.

Eddard Stark : I've missed you, too.

Lyanna : I want to be brave.

Eddard Stark : Shh. You are.

Lyanna : I'm not.

Lyanna : I don't want to die.

Eddard Stark : You're not going to die.

Eddard Stark : Get her some water!

Lyanna : No, no water.

Eddard Stark : Is there a maester?

Lyanna : Please. Listen to me, Ned.

Lyanna : If Robert finds out, he'll kill him, you know he will. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned. Promise me.

Lyanna : Promise me, Ned. Promise me.

Vale Knight : You can't expect Knights of the Vale to side with wildling invaders.

Tormund : We didn't invade. We were invited.

Vale Knight : Not by me.

Jon Snow : The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield.

Man : The Boltons are defeated. The war is over. Winter has come. If the maesters are right, it'll be the coldest one in a thousand years. We should ride home and wait out the coming storms.

Jon Snow : The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won't wait out the storm. He brings the storm.

Lyanna : Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly. But you refused the call. You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton. Still you refuse the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. I don't care if he's a bastard. Ned Stark's blood runs through his veins. He's my king from this day until his last day.

Manderly : Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly. My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. I didn't think we'd find another king in my lifetime. I didn't commit my men to your cause 'cause I didn't want more Manderlys dying for nothing. But I was wrong. Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding. He is the White Wolf. The King in the North.

Glover : I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day. A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness.

Jon Snow : There's nothing to forgive, my lord.

Glover : There will be more fights to come. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousands years. And I will stand behind Jon Snow. the King in the North!

Glover : The King in the North!

All : The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North! The King in the North!

Jaime Lannister : Come on.

Qyburn : I now proclaim Cersei of the House Lannister First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

Qyburn : Long may she reign.

All : Long may she reign.

Walder Frey : You're wonder why I brought you all here. After all, we just had a feast. Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?

Walder Frey : Well, it's no good being lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family. That's what I say!

Walder Frey : I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come. But first, a toast! No more of that Dornish horse piss! This is the finest Arbor gold! Proper wine for proper heroes!

Waldery Frey : Stand together!

All : Stand together!

Walder : Not you. I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.

Walder : Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man. I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot. You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.

Walder : Yes, yes. Cheer. Brave men, all of you. Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home. But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks.

Walder : No, no, that was your mistake. You should have ripped them all out, root and stem.

Walder : Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.

Arya Stark : When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.

Edd : You wildlings?

Meera : I'm Meera Reed, daughter of Howland Reed. This is Brandon Stark, son of Ned Stark.

Edd : How do I know that's true?

Bran Stark : You were at the Fist of the First Men. You were at Hardhome. You've seen the Army of the Dead. You've seen the Night King. He's coming for us. For all of us.

Edd : Okay, come on. Let's get them inside.

Jon Snow : I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow.

Robett : It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.

Jon Snow : Not just the boys.

Jon Snow : We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.

Robett : You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughter's hand?

Lyanna : I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me. I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you.

Robett : Indeed you are, my lady. No one has questioned--

Lyanna : And I don't need your permission to defend the North.

Lyanna : We'll begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.

Jon Snow : While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk.

Jon Snow : But if we're going to survive this winter together...

Tormund : You want us to man the castles for you?

Jon Snow : Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

Tormund : Then that's where I'll go. Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.

Jon Snow : If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold.

Yohn : The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North. Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing.

Sansa Stark : The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay.

All : Aye!

Jon Snow : The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.

Sansa Stark : And then they broke faith.

Jon Snow : I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.

Sansa Stark : So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?

Jon Snow : The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.

Sansa Stark : They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.

Jon Snow : When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, "The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword," and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final.

Jon Snow : Ned Umber.

Jon Snow : Alys Karstark.

Jon Snow : For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon.

Jon Snow : Stand.

Jon Snow : Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?

Ned Alys : Now and always!

Jon Snow : You are my sister, but I am king now.

Sansa Stark : Will you start wearing a crown?

Jon Snow : When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me.

Sansa Stark : So I can't question your decisions anymore?

Jon Snow : Of course you can, but--

Sansa Stark : Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?

Jon Snow : Do you think I'm Joffrey?

Sansa Stark : You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.

Jon Snow : Thank you.

Sansa Stark : You're good at this, you know.

Jon Snow : At what?

Sansa Stark : At ruling.

Jon Snow : No.

Sansa Stark : You are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to--

Sansa Stark : Why are you laughing?

Jon Snow : What did father used to say? Everything before the word "but" is horse shit.

Sansa Stark : He never said that to me.

Jon Snow : No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls.

Sansa Stark : Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying.

Jon Snow : All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me.

Sansa Stark : I'm not trying to undermine you.

Sansa Stark : You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it.

Jon Snow : And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?

Sansa Stark : Would that be so terrible?

Wolkan : A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.

Jon Snow : Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--

Sansa Stark : What does she want?

Jon Snow : Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.

Sansa Stark : You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south.

Jon Snow : I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too.

Sansa Stark : We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.

Jon Snow : There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.

Sansa Stark : You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder.

Jon Snow : You almost sound as if you admire her.

Sansa Stark : I learned a great deal from her.

Jaime Lannister : What is this?

Cersei Lannister : Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not.

Jaime Lannister : He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain.

Cersei Lannister : It's ours now, we just have to take it.

Cersei Lannister : You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?

Jaime Lannister : No, not angry.

Cersei Lannister : Are you afraid of me?

Jaime Lannister : Should I be?

Cersei Lannister : Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?

Jaime Lannister : Dragonstone.

Jaime Lannister : They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born.

Cersei Lannister : Enemies to the east.

Cersei Lannister : Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.

Cersei Lannister : Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor.

Cersei Lannister : Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?

Jaime Lannister : Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock.

Cersei Lannister : Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?

Jaime Lannister : If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side.

Cersei Lannister : I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

Jaime Lannister : Three kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in.

Cersei Lannister : I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.

Jaime Lannister : A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.

Cersei Lannister : A dynasty for us, then.

Jaime Lannister : We never talked about Tommen.

Cersei Lannister : There's nothing to say.

Jaime Lannister : Our baby boy killed himself.

Cersei Lannister : He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?

Jaime Lannister : Cersei--

Cersei Lannister : I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count.

Jaime Lannister : Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.

Cersei Lannister : I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?

Jaime Lannister : We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone.

Cersei Lannister : You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?

Jaime Lannister : The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?

Cersei Lannister : Not all of them.

Jaime Lannister : Well, it looks like all of them.

Cersei Lannister : I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are.

Jaime Lannister : How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.

Cersei Lannister : So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing.

Jaime Lannister : They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves.

Cersei Lannister : Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.

Jaime Lannister : Oh, what did he come here for, then?

Cersei Lannister : A queen.

Euron Greyjoy : The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you.

Euron Greyjoy : It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together.

Jaime Lannister : You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?

Jaime Lannister : The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there.

Euron Greyjoy : I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance.

Jaime Lannister : The people I was cutting down were your own kin.

Euron Greyjoy : The place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.

Jaime Lannister : And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.

Euron Greyjoy : A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas.

Cersei Lannister : If not the most humble.

Euron Greyjoy : You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south.

Cersei Lannister : What do you want in return?

Euron Greyjoy : Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands.

Cersei Lannister : I decline your proposal.

Euron Greyjoy : Why?

Cersei Lannister : You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.

Euron Greyjoy : You should try it. Feels wonderful.

Euron Greyjoy : I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you.

Marwyn : Ah, Maester Weyland. A drinker's liver if ever I saw one.

Marwyn : Weigh that.

Marwyn : The triumph of transitory pleasures. Mankindo s curse.

Sam : Archmaester, I was wondering...

Marwyn : What's the weight?

Sam : Um, 147.

Sam : I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.

Marwyn : I don't remember your proposition.

Sam : I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library.

Marwyn : That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?

Sam : No.

Marwyn : Not a very strong proposition, is it?

Sam : Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place.

Marwyn : Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.

Sam : Sources in the restricted area?

Marwyn : The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.

Sam : So, you believe me.

Marwyn : I do. You'll finish weighing that heart?

Sam : That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.

Marwyn : We're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this worldo s memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. "How will we survive?" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush"--The end is near! How will we survive?" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended.

Marwyn : Be a good lad. Clean this up.

Brienne : Nope.

Tormund : You're a lucky man.

Petyr : I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat. She's a very impressive woman.

Sansa Stark : What do you want, Lord Baelish?

Petyr : I want you to be happy. I want you to be safe.

Sansa Stark : I am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me.

Petyr : What about happy? Why aren't you happy? What do you want that you do not have?

Sansa Stark : At the moment, peace and quiet.

Sansa Stark : No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever.

Petyr : My lady.

Brienne : Why is he still here?

Sansa Stark : We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us.

Brienne : He wants something.

Sansa Stark : I know exactly what he wants.

Man : He rode through the streets of the city / Down from his hill on high / O'er the winds and the steps and the cobble / He rode to a woman's sigh / For she was his secret treasure / She was his shame and his bliss / And a chain and a keep are nothing / Compared to a woman's kiss / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are warm / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are--

Arya Stark : That's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.

Man : It's a new one.

Man : Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.

Arya Stark : I don't want to steal your food.

Man : You're not stealing, we're offering. Come on, it's gonna be a cold night.

Man : You heading south?

Arya Stark : King's Landing.

Man : Poor girl.

Arya Stark : Not so bad, is it?

Man : Depends on your taste, I guess. If you like your streets covered in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you.

Man : All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit. Then when I finally make it, they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell, and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin.

Man : The people who live there, they'd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide.

Man : Worst place in the world.

Arya Stark : What are you doing in the Riverlands?

Man : There's been some trouble with the Freys up at The Twins, so we're part of the army that's been sent to keep the peace.

Man : Here you go. Guests first.

Arya Stark : Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough.

Man : My mother always told me to be kind to strangers. Strangers will be kind to you.

Arya Stark : You're a long way from home. I'm sure you've had some adventures, though.

Man : Yeah, endless adventures. They'll be singing about us for a thousand years.

Man : 3; The truth is when we left home, we couldn't wait to get away. But now we've been gone a while, we can't wait to get home.

Man : I just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone. I ought o be out there with him.

Man : My wife's just had our first baby.

Arya Stark : Boy or girl?

Man : Oh, who knows? You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?

Man : I hope it's a girl.

Arya Stark : Why?

Man : Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old. Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars.

Man : Are you old enough to drink?

Man : It's blackberry wine. I made it myself.

Arya Stark : It's really good.

Man : So, why is a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?

Arya Stark : I'm going to kill the queen.

Thoros : Bad night to be outdoors.

Sandor : You've got real powerful magic to figure that out. Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? "It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy. It's gonna be a cold night."

Thoros : You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane? You want some rum?

Sandor : Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.

Thoros : Why are you always in such a foul mood?

Sandor : Experience.

Beric : This seems like a good place to spend the night.

Sandor : These people don't want us here.

Beric : Seems deserted to me. No livestock. No smoke coming from the chimney.

Sandor : I don't like the look of it.

Thoros : For a big, hard man, you scare easy.

Sandor : I'll tell you what doesn't scare me

Thoros : Come on. Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.

Sandor : They don't.

Thoros : See if there's a larder. They always leave something behind.

Beric : How do you think it ended for them?

Sandor : With death.

Beric : Girl died in her father's arms. Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet. I'd say they were starving. And rather than letting his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them.

Sandor : Doesn't matter now.

Beric : No, doesn't matter now.

Sandor : I've known you a long time, Dondarrion.

Beric : Aye. I think the first time we met was at that tournament--

Sandor : And I always thought you were dull as dirt.

Sandor : You're not bad. I don't hate you. Don't like, but you're not bad.

Beric : Thank you, Clegane. That warms the heart.

Sandor : But there's nothing special about you.

Beric : You're right about that.

Sandor : So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? I've met better men than you, and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere. None of them came back. So, why you?

Beric : You think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?

Sandor : And?

Beric : I don't know. I don't understand our Lord.

Sandor : Your Lord.

Beric : I don't know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.

Sandor : If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?

Thoros : Clegane.

Thoros : Come over here. Don't worry. The fire won't bite. I want to show you something.

Sandor : It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.

Beric : Aye. Almost seems like divine justice.

Sandor : There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt. If there was, you'd be dead...and that girl would be alive.

Sandor : What do you want?

Thoros : Look into the flames.

Sandor : I don't want to look in the damn flames.

Thoros : You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down. Don't you want to know what gave me the power?

Sandor : I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.

Thoros : We can't tell you. Only the fire can tell you.

Thoros : What do you see?

Sandor : Logs burning.

Thoros : Keep looking. What do you see?

Sandor : Ice. A wall of ice. The Wall.

Thoros : What else?

Sandor : It's where the Wall meets the sea. There's a castle there.

Sandor : There's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past.

Sandor : Thousands of them.

Beric : Do you believe me now, Clegane? Do you believe we're here for a reason?

Thoros : What the hell are you doing, Clegane?

Sandor : Burying the dead.

Thoros : You knew these people.

Sandor : Not really.

Sandor : We ask the Father to judge us with mercy. We ask the Mother to... Fuck it, I don't remember the rest. I'm sorry you're dead. You deserved better. Both of you.

Little Sam : Mom.

Gilly : You should really sleep, Sam.

Sam : The dead don't.

Gilly : Legends of the Long Night.

Sam : The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.

Gilly : What is it?

Sam : It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.

Gilly : That's dragonglass?

Sam : A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know.

Jorah Mormont : Has she come yet?

Sam : Who?

Jorah Mormont : The Dragon Queen. Daenerys Stormborn.

Sam : Haven't heard anything.

Daenerys Targaryen : Shall we begin?

Tyrion Lannister : On a night like this, you came into the world.

Varys : I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.

Daenerys Targaryen : I wish I could remember it.

Daenerys Targaryen : I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.

Tyrion Lannister : We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.

Daenerys Targaryen : Good.

Daenerys Targaryen : Not so many lions.

Varys : Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now...

Daenerys Targaryen : They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?

Daenerys Targaryen : People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them.

Daenerys Targaryen : If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already.

Tyrion Lannister : Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.

Daenerys Targaryen : No.

Tyrion Lannister : We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south.

Daenerys Targaryen : I never properly thanked you for that.

Varys : They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you.

Daenerys Targaryen : You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?

Varys : I did.

Daenerys Targaryen : And then you served the man who overthrew him?

Varys : I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe.

Daenerys Targaryen : But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.

Varys : Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king.

Daenerys Targaryen : So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--

Daenerys Targaryen : Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?

Varys : Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful.

Daenerys Targaryen : So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.

Varys : Which you turned to your advantage.

Daenerys Targaryen : Who gave the order to kill me?

Varys : King Robert.

Daenerys Targaryen : Who hired the assassins?

Daenerys Targaryen : Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?

Varys : Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--

Daenerys Targaryen : To keep yourself alive.

Tyrion Lannister : Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.

Daenerys Targaryen : Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?

Varys : The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you.

Daenerys Targaryen : Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.

Varys : I swear it, my queen.

Daenerys Targaryen : And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive.

Varys : I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.

Grey Worm : Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you.

Melisandre : Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded. It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains.

Daenerys Targaryen : The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name?

Melisandre : I am called Melisandre.

Varys : She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne. It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?

Melisandre : No, it didn't.

Daenerys Targaryen : You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.

Daenerys Targaryen : We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.

Daenerys Targaryen : The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?

Melisandre : Not yet. But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.

Daenerys Targaryen : What does your Lord expect from me?

Melisandre : The Long Night is coming. Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.

Daenerys Targaryen : The prince who was promised will bring the dawn. I'm afraid I'm not a prince.

Missandei : Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate. That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn.

Tyrion Lannister : Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?

Daenerys Targaryen : No, but I like it better.

Daenerys Targaryen : And you believe this prophecy refers to me?

Melisandre : Prophecies are dangerous things. I believe you have a role to play, as does another. The King in the North, Jon Snow.

Tyrion Lannister : Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?

Daenerys Targaryen : You know him?

Tyrion Lannister : I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.

Varys : And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?

Melisandre : As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger. As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.

Daenerys Targaryen : He sounds like quite a man.

Melisandre : Summon Jon Snow. Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes.

Tyrion Lannister : I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character.

Tyrion Lannister : If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.

Daenerys Targaryen : Very well. Send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.

Sansa Stark : Do you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.

Jon Snow : Read the last bit.

Sansa Stark : All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes." What does that mean?

Jon Snow : It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?

Sansa Stark : Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters. He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk. "The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne. Join us. Together we can end her tyranny."

Davos : Sounds like a charmer. Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming.

Jon Snow : What?

Davos : Fire kills Whites, you told me. What breathes fire?

Sansa Stark : You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?

Davos : No, too dangerous.

Jon Snow : But?

Davos : But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?

Cersei Lannister : If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it. Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell. But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown. With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores. Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts. Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought. This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.

Cersei Lannister : You all remember the Mad King. You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people. His daughter is no different. In Essos her brutality is already legendary. She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay. And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons.

Cersei Lannister : It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords. We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her.

Randyll : She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace. The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms. How do you propose to stop them?

Qyburn : We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord.

Jaime Lannister : Lord Tarley.

Randyll : Ser, Jaime. I believe you know my son.

Dickon : Ser, Jaime.

Jaime Lannister : Rickon, isn't it?

Dickon : Dickon.

Jaime Lannister : That's it.

Jaime Lannister : Thank you for coming. The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever. They might not have come if you hadn't.

Randyll : If my queen summons me, I answer the call. And I've heard what she does to those that defy her.

Jaime Lannister : Do you ride for Hornhill today?

Randyll : I have an army to mobilize. It won't be long until the fighting starts.

Jaime Lannister : And what side will you be fighting for? You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle. Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --

Randyll : It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?

Jaime Lannister : I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come. I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies. All of her enemies.

Randyll : Including Olenna Tyrell? I'm a Tarley. That name means something. We're not oath breakers. We're not schemers. We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings. I swore an oath to House Tyrell.

Jaime Lannister : You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley.

Randyll : I've known Olenna since I was a child.

Jaime Lannister : She was a great woman, once. Now she's broken. She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores. The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history. I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice. Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?

Jaime Lannister : When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south. I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.

Marwyn : The infection has spread too far. You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.

Jorah Mormont : How long?

Marwyn : It will be years before it kills you. It could be 10, could be 20.

Jorah Mormont : But how long 'till...

Marwyn : Your mind? Six months, maybe fewer.

Sam Tarly : Pardon, Archmaester. I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black. She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured. Isn't there some way --

Marwyn : Does this look like a baby to you?

Sam Tarly : No.

Marwyn : Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?

Marwyn : Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.

Marwyn : This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser. Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men. As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day. How you choose to spend that time is up to you.

Marwyn : Come, Samwell.

Sam Tarly : Should we send word to your family, Ser...

Jorah Mormont : Jorah. Jorah Mormont.

Sam Tarly : Mormont?

Jorah Mormont : There's no need. I've been dead to them for years.

Qyburn : Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?

Cersei Lannister : No, I can't say I have. I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room.

Qyburn : Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.

Cersei Lannister : They were his trophies. He couldn't keep them around. They would have made him look small. Sometimes he would come down here and look at them. I believe he brought his whores on occasion.

Qyburn : Balerion the Dread. The beast that Aegon rode across the sea. Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel. Powerful, but not invincible.

Qyburn : Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen. If they can be wounded, they can be killed.

Qyburn : The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace. If you'd kindly pull that lever.

Yara Greyjoy : If you want the Iron Throne, take it. We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons. We should hit King's Landing now. Hard. With everything we have. The city will fall within a day.

Tyrion Lannister : If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.

Ellaria : It's called war. You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding.

Tyrion Lannister : I know how you wage war. We don't poison little girls here. Myrcella was innocent.

Ellaria : She was a Lannister. There are no innocent Lannisters. My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.

Daenerys Targaryen : That's enough. Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen. You will treat him with respect.

Daenerys Targaryen : I am not here to be queen of the ashes.

Olenna Tyrell : That's very nice to hear. Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter. The common people loved her, the nobles loved her. And what is left of her now? Ashes. Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really. They won't obey you unless they fear you.

Daenerys Targaryen : I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing.

Olenna Tyrell : Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne? By asking nicely?

Daenerys Targaryen : We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.

Tyrion Lannister : But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.

Tyrion Lannister : Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country. If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point. Our army should be Westerosi.

Ellia : And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?

Tyrion Lannister : You are.

Tyrion Lannister : Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.

Tyrion Lannister : The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army. Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.

Olenna Tyrell : So, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?

Tyrion Lannister : The unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.

Daenerys Targaryen : Do I have your support?

Yara Greyjoy : You have mine.

Ellia : Dorne is with you, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : Thank you all. Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?

Daenerys Targaryen : I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.

Olenna Tyrell : Peace. Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his? Peace never lasts, my dear. Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?

Olenna Tyrell : He's a clever man, your Hand. I've known a great many clever men. I've outlived them all. Do you know why? I ignored them. The lords of Westeros are sheep. Are you a sheep? No. You're a dragon. Be a dragon.

Grey Worm : Enter.

Missandei : You leave tomorrow. Were you going to say goodbye?

Grey Worm : I will see you when I return.

Missandei : But you don't know when that will be.

Grey Worm : No one knows.

Missandei : I wish you good fortune.

Grey Worm : Missandei --

Grey Worm : It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.

Missandei : Why?

Grey Worm : You know why.

Missandei : I don't.

Grey Worm : You are my weakness.

Missandei : That's what I am? Your weakness?

Grey Worm : When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears. One boy is scared of dogs. One boy hates high places. One is frightened of the ocean. They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff. They throw him in the water. If he learns to swim, good. If he drowns, good. Either way, strong Unsullied. But I had no fears. I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always.

Missandei : I believe it.

Grey Worm : Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth. Now I have fear.

Missandei : I do too.

Grey Worm : No.

Missandei : I want to see you. Please.

Marwyn : It might be useful. Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.

Sam Tarly : Archmaester, I wanted to --

Marwyn : And this one.

Marwyn : Maester Faol was quite the opposite. A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.

Sam Tarly : I wanted to ask you --

Marwyn : If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research. If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style. I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread.

Marwyn : What? You don't like the title? What would you call it then?

Sam Tarly : Possibly something a bit more poetic?

Marwyn : We're not poets, Tarley.

Sam Tarly : Archmaester, if I could just have a moment.

Marwyn : This is your moment. Use it wisely.

Sam Tarly : I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah. There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured. I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.

Marwyn : I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.

Sam Tarly : Oh, you are?

Marwyn : Yes. Should I tell you how he died? From Greyscale.

Sam Tarly : Oh.

Marwyn : The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.

Sam Tarly : Hello.

Jorah Mormont : What are you doing?

Sam Tarly : You're Jorah Mormont. You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.

Sam Tarly : My name is Samwell Tarley. I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black. I knew your father. I was with him when he died. You're not dying today, Ser Jorah.

Sam Tarly : Drink this.

Jorah Mormont : What is it?

Sam Tarly : Rum. Drink it all, please. I'm afraid this is going to hurt.

Sam Tarly : If you could take off your shirt.

Sam Tarly : If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard. I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here. If they hear you screaming then we're both finished.

Jorah Mormont : Have you ever done this before?

Sam Tarly : No. No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got. Have a seat. I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --

Sam Tarly : Shh, shhh. Again, I'm sorry. Please try not to scream.

Man : They say her dragons are bigger than Aegons.

Man : Horse shit. Cersei is just trying to frighten us.

Man : If it's true, if she lays siege to King's Landing prices will triple.

Man : As long as we get back there before they start.

Man : One more round. It's a long ride.

Hot Pie : Ary!

Arya Stark : Hello, Hot Pie. Sit down. Who's that for?

Arya Stark : Mmm. This is good.

Hot Pie : You think so? The secret is browning the butter before making the dough. Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.

Arya Stark : I didn't do that.

Hot Pie : You've been making pies?

Arya Stark : One or two.

Hot Pie : I can't believe you're here. Did you meet the big lady?

Arya Stark : Big lady?

Hot Pie : The lady knight. I figured she was a knight because she had armor on. She was looking for your sister but I told her about you. Did she ever find you?

Arya Stark : She found me.

Hot Pie : What happened to you Ary?

Arya Stark : You got any ale?

Hot Pie : Where are you heading?

Arya Stark : King's Landing.

Hot Pie : Why?

Arya Stark : I heard Cersei's queen now.

Hot Pie : I heard she blew up the Great Sept. That must have been something to see. Boom.

Arya Stark : Hmm.

Hot Pie : I can't believe someone could do that.

Arya Stark : Cersei would do that.

Hot Pie : I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.

Arya Stark : Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.

Hot Pie : No. The Boltons are dead.

Arya Stark : What?

Hot Pie : Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards. He's King in the North now.

Arya Stark : You're lying.

Hot Pie : Why would I lie about that? He's your brother right?

Arya Stark : Thanks for the pie.

Hot Pie : Friends don't pay. I can't believe I thought you were a boy. You're pretty.

Arya Stark : Thanks.

Arya Stark : Take care of yourself, Hot Pie. Try not to get killed.

Hot Pie : No, I won't. I'm like you, Ary. I'm a survivor.

Jon Snow : Come in.

Wolkan : A raven, My King, from the Citadel.

Jon Snow : This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.

Jon Snow : I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.

Jon Snow : He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons.

Jon Snow : Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.

Jon Snow : We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.

Jon Snow : But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone.

Sansa Stark : Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.

Jon Snow : I know that.

Sansa Stark : She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. The north is one of those seven kingdoms. This isn't an invitation, it's a trap.

Jon Snow : It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man.

Yohn Royce : Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa. I remember the Mad King all too well. A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister.

Robett Glover : We called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom.

Lyanna Mormont : Winter is here, Your Grace. We need the King in the North in the north.

Jon Snow : You all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it.

Sansa Stark : Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.

Jon Snow : Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me.

Sansa Stark : You're abandoning your people. Your abandoning your home.

Jon Snow : I'm leaving both in good hands.

Sansa Stark : Whose?

Jon Snow : Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours.

Petyr Baelish : I delivered his bones myself. I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister. It seems like a lifetime ago. Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.

Petyr Baelish : I was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm.

Jon Snow : You don't belong down here.

Petyr Baelish : Forgive me. We have never talked properly. I wanted to remedy that.

Jon Snow : I have nothing to say to you.

Petyr Baelish : Not even thank you? If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield. You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them. I love Sansa as I loved her mother.

Jon Snow : Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.

Arya Stark : Nymeria?

Arya Stark : Nymeria, it's me, Arya. I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home. Come with me.

Arya Stark : Come with me.

Arya Stark : That's not you.

Nymeria : You can't have them all. It's not fair.

Obara : I'm oldest.

Tyene : Momma will want Cersei for herself.

Obara : She's not my momma. You can have Cersei. I want The Mountain.

Nymeria : The Mountain killed father. He'll crush you with one hand.

Tyene : Father got careless. That's what Momma says.

Obara : Will you shut up about Momma? Momma, momma.

Tyene : Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.

Ellaria : How can you drink this piss? When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world. Have you ever been to Dorne?

Yara Greyjoy : A few times. Never stayed long.

Ellaria : A boy in every port?

Yara Greyjoy : A boy, a girl. Depends on the port.

Ellaria : Could we get some more?

Yara Greyjoy : I thought it wasn't for you.

Ellaria : I'm developing a taste for it.

Yara Greyjoy : He's not your servant.

Theon Greyjoy : It's fine.

Ellaria : So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands.

Yara Greyjoy : Once I kill my uncle.

Ellaria : And what will you be, handsome?

Theon Greyjoy : Whatever my queen demands.

Yara Greyjoy : He'll be my advisor, my protector.

Ellaria : Oh, I see. Your protector.

Ellaria : So if someone gets too close to you --

Yara Greyjoy : He might have to intervene.

Ellaria : hold that person back.

Yara Greyjoy : Until they've made their intentions known.

Ellaria : Why are you standing all the way over there then? A foreign invasion is under way. It seems like you don't need a protector.

Yara Greyjoy : Stay here.

Yara Greyjoy : Euron.

Yara Greyjoy : Your mother is below deck. Keep her safe.

Ellaria : Kill us! Get it over with!

Euron Greyjoy : Give your uncle a kiss.

Euron Greyjoy : Theon!

Euron Greyjoy : Ah, come on your cockless hound. I have her. Come and get her.

End : CREDITS

Tyrion Lannister : The bastard of Winterfell.

Jon Snow : The dwarf of Casterly Rock.

Tyrion Lannister : I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.

Jon Snow : You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road.

Tyrion Lannister : It's been a long road. But we're both still here.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm Tyrion Lannister.

Davos : Davos Seaworth.

Tyrion Lannister : and DAVOS shake hands.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

Davos : Unluckily for me.

Tyrion Lannister : Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.

Missandei : Welcome to Dragonstone. Our queen knows this is a long journey. She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf. If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.

Jon Snow : Of course.

Missandei : Please, this way.

Davos : Where are you from? I can't place the accent.

Missandei : I was born on the Island of Naarth.

Davos : Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there. Palm trees and butterflies. I haven't been myself.

Davos : This place has changed.

Tyrion Lannister : And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well.

Jon Snow : She is.

Tyrion Lannister : Does she miss me terribly?

Tyrion Lannister : A sham marriage and unconsummated.

Jon Snow : I didn't ask --

Tyrion Lannister : Well, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on.

Jon Snow : She's starting to let on.

Tyrion Lannister : Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.

Jon Snow : As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.

Tyrion Lannister : A long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it.

Jon Snow : My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south.

Jon Snow : True. But I'm not a Stark.

Tyrion Lannister : I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do.

Tyrion Lannister : Come. Their mother is waiting for you.

Varys : I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King in the North. Don't you want to see him again?

Melisandre : I've done my part. I've brought ice and fire together.

Varys : Strange. You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff. I didn't take you for a bashful girl.

Melisandre : My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.

Varys : Oh, I doubt that. Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man. Nothing is ever so sweet again.

Melisandre : Neither of us is common folk anymore. I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor.

Varys : Why?

Melisandre : Because of mistakes I made. Terrible mistakes. I would only be a distraction if I stayed.

Varys : So where will you go?

Melisandre : Volantis.

Varys : Good. If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros. I'm not sure you'd be safe here.

Melisandre : I will return, dear spider. One last time.

Varys : My Lady --

Melisandre : I have to die in this strange country, just like you.

Missandei : You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains.

Davos : This is Jon Snow.

Davos : He's King in the North.

Daenerys Targaryen : Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren't too rough.

Jon Snow : The winds were kind, Your Grace.

Davos : Apologies. I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know. But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace. He's not a lord.

Daenerys Targaryen : Forgive me --

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.

Daenerys Targaryen : Forgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong?

Davos : I wasn't there, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : No. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?

Tyrion Lannister : Forever.

Daenerys Targaryen : Forever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee.

Jon Snow : I am not.

Daenerys Targaryen : Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?

Jon Snow : Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.

Daenerys Targaryen : My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it.

Jon Snow : You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.

Daenerys Targaryen : Then why are you here?

Jon Snow : Because I need your help and you need mine.

Daenerys Targaryen : Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?

Jon Snow : I did.

Daenerys Targaryen : And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?

Jon Snow : They're hard to miss.

Daenerys Targaryen : But still, I need your help?

Davos : Not to defeat Cersei. You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall. Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons.

Tyrion Lannister : Almost.

Jon Snow : But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.

Daenerys Targaryen : Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.

Jon Snow : Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair.

Daenerys Targaryen : You told me you liked this man.

Tyrion Lannister : I do.

Daenerys Targaryen : In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child.

Tyrion Lannister : I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.

Jon Snow : Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north.

Daenerys Targaryen : As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north.

Jon Snow : I am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy.

Daenerys Targaryen : The dead?

Daenerys Targaryen : Is that another figure of speech?

Jon Snow : The Army of the Dead is on the march.

Tyrion Lannister : The Army of the Dead?

Jon Snow : You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?

Tyrion Lannister : No, I don't think you're either of those things.

Jon Snow : The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --

Jon Snow : we're finished.

Daenerys Targaryen : I was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.

Daenerys Targaryen : We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea.

Daenerys Targaryen : They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.

Jon Snow : You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.

Tyrion Lannister : The war against my sister has already begun. You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --

Tyrion Lannister : whatever you saw beyond the wall.

Davos : You don't believe him. I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.

Davos : But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North. You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros. He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen. He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He was named King in the North. Not because of his birthright. He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard. All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him.

Davos : All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things. He fought those things for the good of his people. He risked his life for his people. He took a knife in the heart for his people. He gave his own --

Davos : If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die. And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.

Tyrion Lannister : If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.

Tyrion Lannister : Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys. Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.

Jon Snow : There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --

Tyrion Lannister : It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.

Jon Snow : And why would I do that?

Jon Snow : I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can.

Daenerys Targaryen : That's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion.

Daenerys Targaryen : You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.

Jon Snow : Am I your prisoner?

Daenerys Targaryen : Not yet.

Varys : Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.

Daenerys Targaryen : And?

Varys : Two or three ships escaped. The rest sunk our captured. Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured. The Greyjoys are dead or captured.

Daenerys Targaryen : All of them?

Captain : Your sister's dead?

Theon Greyjoy : Euron has her.

Captain : You saw him take her? And you got away?

Theon Greyjoy : I couldn't save her. I tried.

Captain : You wouldn't be here if you tried.

Euron Greyjoy : This is the life. Look at them. Cheering for a Greyjoy.

Euron Greyjoy : I have to be honest, it's making me hard. Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?

Euron Greyjoy : Oh no!

Euron Greyjoy : What a twat.

Euron Greyjoy : My queen. Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.

Euron Greyjoy : I give you --

Euron Greyjoy : what no other man could give. Justice. Justice for your murdered daughter.

Cersei Lannister : You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.

Euron Greyjoy : A bit more than a true friend.

Cersei Lannister : And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.

Euron Greyjoy : There's only one reward I want.

Cersei Lannister : You shall have what your heart desires --

Cersei Lannister : when the war is won.

Cersei Lannister : With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country.

Euron Greyjoy : There's nothing quite like it, is there? The love of the people. I suppose you wouldn't know.

Jaime Lannister : This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.

Euron Greyjoy : Or yours. They just like severed heads really. Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers.

Jaime Lannister : Advice?

Euron Greyjoy : Does she like it gentle or rough? A finger in the bum?

Euron Greyjoy : Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now. We'll talk later.

Cersei Lannister : I want you to know I understand. Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you. I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head. I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking.

Cersei Lannister : The sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that?

Cersei Lannister : It doesn't matter now.

Cersei Lannister : Your daughter is a beauty too. Brown eyes, those lips. A perfect Dornish beauty.

Cersei Lannister : I imagine she is your favorite.

Cersei Lannister : I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But still, we're only human. We love who we love.

Cersei Lannister : I'm sorry. I can't understand you. The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying. It must be frustrating.

Cersei Lannister : We all make our choices. You chose to murder my daughter. You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.

Cersei Lannister : Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast.

Cersei Lannister : I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.

Cersei Lannister : She's so beautiful. The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right.

Tyene : Momma!

Cersei Lannister : Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know. Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella. The long goodbye, was that it?

Qyburn : The Long Farewell.

Cersei Lannister : That's the one.

Cersei Lannister : How long does the poison take?

Qyburn : Difficult to say. Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution.

Cersei Lannister : But death is certain?

Qyburn : Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain.

Cersei Lannister : Your daughter will die here in this cell. You will be here watching when she does. You will be here the rest of your days. If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat. You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made.

Cersei Lannister : Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours. I don't want her to miss a thing.

Jaime Lannister : No.

Jaime Lannister : Don't.

Jaime Lannister : What are you doing? No one can see us like this ?

Cersei Lannister : I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.

Messenger : Forgive me, Your Grace. The visitor from Braavos has arrived.

Cersei Lannister : Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.

Messenger : At once, Your Grace.

Tycho : No, thank you.

Tycho : My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son. From all reports he was a fine young man.

Cersei Lannister : The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.

Tycho : Condolences and congratulations. You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms. That's quite an accomplishment. The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.

Cersei Lannister : The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.

Tycho : Indeed. But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.

Cersei Lannister : The Iron Bank wants its gold back.

Tycho : Your father never minced words either. But, yes, your debts are considerable. And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts. We both know how expensive war can be.

Cersei Lannister : And we both know gold wins wars. Your vaults are empty. Your late husbando s profligacy saw to that.

Tycho : Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies. You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.

Cersei Lannister : And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.

Tycho : We don't make bets. We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.

Cersei Lannister : That's a fancy way of saying bet. The war has already begun. I've drawn first blood. I decapitated the Dornish snake. My armada owns the Narrow Sea.

Tycho : Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.

Cersei Lannister : Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.

Tycho : For now. Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons. How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?

Cersei Lannister : Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?

Tycho : The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true.

Cersei Lannister : From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?

Cersei Lannister : The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?

Tycho : Your father's daughter indeed.

Cersei Lannister : Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.

Tyrion Lannister : I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.

Jon Snow : I'm a prisoner on this island.

Tyrion Lannister : I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want.

Jon Snow : Except to my ship. They took my ship.

Tyrion Lannister : I wouldn't say we took your ship.

Jon Snow : I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.

Tyrion Lannister : Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.

Jon Snow : It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --

Jon Snow : You probably don't believe me.

Tyrion Lannister : I do actually.

Jon Snow : You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.

Tyrion Lannister : It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.

Jon Snow : How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?

Tyrion Lannister : Good question.

Jon Snow : I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.

Tyrion Lannister : People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister.

Jon Snow : I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.

Tyrion Lannister : It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.

Jon Snow : Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool.

Tyrion Lannister : Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask.

Tyrion Lannister : So do you have anything reasonable to ask?

Jon Snow : What do you mean?

Tyrion Lannister : Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.

Daenerys Targaryen : Dragonglass?

Tyrion Lannister : Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.

Daenerys Targaryen : Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.

Tyrion Lannister : Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.

Daenerys Targaryen : And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?

Tyrion Lannister : Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature.

Daenerys Targaryen : And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?

Tyrion Lannister : I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it.

Daenerys Targaryen : Which wise man said this?

Tyrion Lannister : I don't remember.

Daenerys Targaryen : Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?

Tyrion Lannister : I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock.

Daenerys Targaryen : What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?

Tyrion Lannister : You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.

Jon Snow : Amazing thing to see.

Daenerys Targaryen : I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.

Daenerys Targaryen : You lost two brothers as well?

Daenerys Targaryen : People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.

Jon Snow : You've been talking to Tyrion?

Daenerys Targaryen : He is my Hand.

Jon Snow : He enjoys talking.

Daenerys Targaryen : We all enjoy what we're good at.

Jon Snow : I don't.

Daenerys Targaryen : You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.

Jon Snow : I never expected that you would.

Daenerys Targaryen : And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.

Jon Snow : I haven't either.

Daenerys Targaryen : I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.

Jon Snow : Thank you.

Jon Snow : So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?

Daenerys Targaryen : You better get to work, Jon Snow.

Sansa Stark : How much do we have?

Wolkan : 4,000 bushels, My Lady.

Sansa Stark : What does that mean?

Yohn : For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more.

Sansa Stark : What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?

Wolkan : I'm not entirely certain. I'll check Maester Llewyn's records. He kept a copy of every raven scroll.

Sansa Stark : You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell.

Wolkan : No, My Lady, most likely not.

Sansa Stark : We must prepare for that eventuality. Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be. We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north. If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them.

Yohn : Very wise, My Lady.

Sansa Stark : Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?

Sansa Stark : Are they covering those breastplates in leather?

Yohn : No, My Lady.

Sansa Stark : Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?

Yohn : They should indeed. Pardon me, My Lady.

Yohn : You there, why isn't there leather on these?

Petyr Baelish : Command suits you. The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.

Sansa Stark : So they should be.

Petyr Baelish : I know Cersei better than anyone here. If you turn your back on her --

Sansa Stark : You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.

Petyr Baelish : I only meant to say --

Sansa Stark : That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous? Thank you for your wise council.

Petyr Baelish : One of two things will happen. Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end. Or life will win out. And what then?

Petyr Baelish : Don't fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before.

Guard : Lady Sansa, at the gate.

Bran Stark : Hello, Sansa.

Sansa Stark : I wish Jon was here.

Bran Stark : Yes. I need to speak to him.

Sansa Stark : Your father's last living true born son. You're Lord of Winterfell.

Bran Stark : I can never be the Lord of Winterfell. I can never be lord of anything. I'm the three-eyed raven.

Sansa Stark : I don't know what that means.

Bran Stark : It's difficult to explain.

Sansa Stark : Try, please, for me.

Bran Stark : It means I can see everything. Everything that's ever happened to everyone. Everything that's happening right now. It's all pieces, fragments. I need to learn to see better. When the long night comes again I need to be ready.

Sansa Stark : How do you know all of this?

Bran Stark : The three-eyed raven taught me.

Sansa Stark : I thought you were the three-eyed raven.

Bran Stark : I told you it's difficult to explain.

Sansa Stark : Bran --

Bran Stark : I'm sorry for all that's happened to you. I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home. It was so beautiful that night. Snow falling just like now. And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.

Sansa Stark : I have to go back inside, Bran.

Bran Stark : I'll stay a bit longer.

Marwyn : Hmm.

Marwyn : Hmm. Does it hurt?

Jorah Mormont : A bit. Less than before.

Marwyn : The infection no longer appears to be active.

Marwyn : Unusual. Unlikely. One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.

Jorah Mormont : I don't know anything about that. I just started feeling better. I assumed it was the rest that did it.

Jorah Mormont : And the climate.

Marwyn : The climate? You're free to go, Ser. This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer.

Marwyn : Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening.

Jorah Mormont : How bad is it?

Sam Tarly : I suppose I'll find out this evening.

Sam Tarly : Where will you go?

Jorah Mormont : I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it. I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could. Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise. The only place for me is with her.

Jorah Mormont : I owe my life to her and you.

Sam Tarly : Your father saved me more than once. It's the least I could do.

Jorah Mormont : Perhaps our paths will cross again?

Sam Tarly : I hope they do.

Marwyn : You treated him?

Sam Tarly : Yes.

Marwyn : Who told you to treat him?

Sam Tarly : No one.

Marwyn : Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?

Sam Tarly : I seem to remember you.

Marwyn : But you treated him anyway?

Sam Tarly : I did.

Marwyn : I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful. Especially on someone of that age. You could have infected yourself and others. You could have devastated the entire Citadel. But you didn't. It's a meticulous, difficult procedure. Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed. But you succeeded. How?

Sam Tarly : I read the books and followed the instructions.

Marwyn : That man is alive because of you. You should be proud.

Sam Tarly : Thank you, Archmaester.

Marwyn : Come here.

Marwyn : All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away. I need you to make copies of them.

Marwyn : You were expecting a reward? Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel. You'd better get started. Be mindful of the paper mites. They like flesh as well.

Daenerys Targaryen : We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.

Varys : Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet. To send our remaining ships after him --

Daenerys Targaryen : I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.

Tyrion Lannister : But you'll have to go yourself. Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place. You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.

Daenerys Targaryen : I wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them?

Missandei : They can still do something to you. It only takes one arrow.

Tyrion Lannister : It's too great a risk. You're too important.

Daenerys Targaryen : What about Casterly Rock?

Varys : The Unsullied will be there soon.

Missandei : And what will they face?

Varys : A difficult situation. They know we're coming.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready.

Tyrion Lannister : No one has ever taken the rock.

Tyrion Lannister : The Lannister army is still the army my father built. Well trained and well provisioned. 10,000 men at least. They will see us coming.

Tyrion Lannister : They will be ready.

Man : Draw! Loose!

Tyrion Lannister : The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.

Tyrion Lannister : The fight up the walls will be hard. We'll be at a disadvantage. Many men will die.

Tyrion Lannister : Interesting thing about my father. He built our house up from near ruin. He built our army. He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers. That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren't welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn't walk them through the front gates. I couldn't have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself.

Tyrion Lannister : It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.

Tyrion Lannister : No better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress.

Tyrion Lannister : As a good friend of mine once said, "give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."

Tyrion Lannister : And so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.

Tyrion Lannister : But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater. They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them. They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triump.

Unsullied : There are none left.

Grey Worm : There are supposed to be more than this. Many more.

Grey Worm : Where are they? Where are the rest of the Lannisters?

Olenna Tyrell : It's done?

Jaime Lannister : It is.

Olenna Tyrell : And now the rains weep for our whores. Did we fight well?

Jaime Lannister : I suppose as well as can be expected.

Olenna Tyrell : It was never our forte. Golden roses indeed. Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.

Jaime Lannister : The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore. Well, it is to me. My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne.

Olenna Tyrell : So you'll just let them take it?

Jaime Lannister : For now. They won't be able to hold it. Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left. Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros.

Olenna Tyrell : And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?

Jaime Lannister : As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood. There are always lessons in failures.

Olenna Tyrell : Yes. You must be very wise by now.

Jaime Lannister : My father always said I was a slow learner.

Olenna Tyrell : If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough. No more learning from my mistakes, eh? How will you do it? With that sword?

Olenna Tyrell : That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it. What did he call it?

Jaime Lannister : Widow's Wail.

Olenna Tyrell : He really was a cunt, wasn't he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders. I never lost a night's sleep over them. They were necessary. And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did. But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining. That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination. She's a monster, you do know that?

Jaime Lannister : To you, sure. To others as well. But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?

Olenna Tyrell : You love her. You really do love her. You poor fool. She'll be the end of you.

Jaime Lannister : Possibly. Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?

Olenna Tyrell : What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right. If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.

Jaime Lannister : Yes, it has.

Olenna Tyrell : She's a disease. I regret my role in spreading it. You will too.

Jaime Lannister : I think we're done here.

Olenna Tyrell : How will it happen?

Jaime Lannister : Cersei had several ideas. Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep. Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing. I talked her out of those.

Olenna Tyrell : Will there be pain?

Jaime Lannister : No. I made sure of that.

Olenna Tyrell : That's good.

Olenna Tyrell : I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple. It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father. It was horrible enough for me. A shocking scene. Not at all what I intended. You see, I'd never seen the posion work before. Tell Cersei. I want her to know it was me.

End : CREDITS

Jaime Lannister : Halt that wagon!

Jaime Lannister : opens the carriage. It is filled with gold bars and coins. He picks up a large sack and hands it to BRONN.

Bronn : You just won the biggest prize in the world. What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on. You can tell me. Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?

Jaime Lannister : I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.

Bronn : There is no more High Septon.

Jaime Lannister : No, there isn't, is there?

Bronn : There is still the question of my prize.

Jaime Lannister : is putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold. He stops and turns to BRONN.

Jaime Lannister : That's a lot of money I just gave you.

Bronn : It's not a castle.

Bronn : turns and points to Highgarden.

Bronn : How about that one? It's available.

Jaime Lannister : You don't want Highgarden.

Bronn : I beg to differ.

Jaime Lannister : We're at war. Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in. Besides, think of the upkeep. The more you own, the more it weighs you down.

Bronn : Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down?

Jaime Lannister : pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting.

Jaime Lannister : They're not mine. The gold belongs to the Iron Bank. We pay our debts.

Bronn : Right. Just not to me.

Jaime Lannister : Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid. When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you.

Bronn : Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful.

Jaime Lannister : Stranger things have happened.

Bronn : Like what?

Randyll : TARLEY and his son DICKON come riding up on horseback. RANDYLL addresses JAIME.

Randyll : The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord.

Jaime Lannister : The current harvest?

Dickon : We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.

Jaime Lannister : looks over to BRONN.

Jaime Lannister : Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?

Bronn : I'm not much for shoveling weight.

Jaime Lannister : No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that.

Randyll : My Lord.

Dickon : My Lord.

Randyll : DICKON and BRONN break away from the Lannister army and ride into the distance. Horse drawn carts are carrying spoils from Highgarden and Lannister men are marching down the road.

Cersei Lannister : and TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion.

Tycho : I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment. I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely.

Cersei Lannister : You're too kind, My Lord.

Tycho : I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace. I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment. And the current arithmetic is outstanding. The gold --

Cersei Lannister : Is on its way. My brother is supervising its transportation himself.

Tycho : Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed. They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.

Cersei Lannister : We must devise a way to raise their spirits.

Tycho : Yes. Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.

Cersei Lannister : My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.

Tycho : I see a great deal of potential in that venture. I imagine that it would require outside investment?

Cersei Lannister : It will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.

Tycho : I know them well. They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.

Cersei Lannister : That's good to hear. I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.

Tycho : Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives.

Bran Stark : is sitting in a wheelchair. PETER BAELISH is sitting next to him. BAELISH unsheathes a Valyrian steel dagger and shows it to BRAN. It's the same dagger used in the attempt to assassinate BRAN years ago.

Petyr Baelish : This is for you.

Petyr Baelish : flips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN.

Petyr Baelish : The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off.

Bran Stark : reaches out and takes the knife, turning it and looking it over carefully.

Petyr Baelish : The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have. I wasn't there for her when she needed me most. But I am here for her now. To do what she would have done, to protect her children. Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask.

Bran Stark : Do you know who this belonged to?

Petyr Baelish : No. That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings. In a way, that dagger made you what you are today. Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall. I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.

Petyr Baelish : hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN. BRAN slides the knife into the sheath.

Petyr Baelish : To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --

Bran Stark : Chaos is a ladder.

Bran Stark : is staring at BAELISH. BAELISH stops speaking. The door opens and Meera appears.

Petyr Baelish : I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark.

Petyr Baelish : stands up to leave.

Bran Stark : I'm not Lord Stark.

Petyr Baelish : bows and walks past Meera and closes the door.

Meera : notices BRAN sitting in a wheelchair.

Meera : What's that?

Bran Stark : Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.

Meera : It's a very good idea.

Bran Stark : You're leaving?

Meera : I don't want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family. And you're safe, safe as anyone can be now. You don't need me anymore.

Bran Stark : No, I don't.

Meera : That's all you've got to say?

Bran Stark : Thank you.

Meera : Thank you?

Bran Stark : For helping me.

Meera : My brother died for you. Hodor and Summer died for you. I almost died for you. Bran!

Bran Stark : I'm not really, not anymore. I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now.

Meera : begins to cry.

Meera : You died in that cave.

Meera : turns to walk out the door. She hesitates looking at BRAN, then walks out.

Arya Stark : approaches the main gate on foot. Two guards are huddled by a brazier getting warm. There's indistinct chatter. One of the men notice ARYA walking to the gate and approach her.

Man : Hey, oh. Where are you going?

Arya Stark : In there. I live here.

Man : Fuck off.

Arya Stark : I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.

Man : Arya Stark is dead.

Arya Stark : Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick. They'll tell you who I am.

Man : There's no Rodrick here.

Man : Maester's name is Wolkan.

Arya Stark : Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North. He's my brother

Man : He's a thousand miles away.

Man : It's cold. We're busy. So, you know, best fuck off.

Man : Mm-hmm.

Arya Stark : If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?

Man : The Lady of Winterfell, Lady Stark.

Arya Stark : Which Lady Stark?

Man : You tell us. You're the one impersonating her sister.

Arya Stark : Tell Sansa her sister is home.

Man : Lady Sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you, just like us. So for the last time, fuck off.

Man : 1 goes to grab Arya but she easily dodges out of his grasp.

Arya Stark : I'm getting into this castle one way or another. If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long. But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away...

Arya Stark : keeps glancing at the men. They look uneasy. They bring her inside of the gate. They indicate towards a cart near the entrance.

Man : You sit there. Right there. Don't move.

Man : Go tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her.

Arya Stark : is glancing around Winterfell. Men are working building tools and cutting wood. ARYA looks over and sees a Winterfell flag sigil hanging from the wall. The two guards are still arguing.

Man : You tell her.

Man : I'm not.

Man : Because if you don't I'll hit you right in the fucking face as hard as I can.

Man : We told her to wait. We were standing right next to her.

Sansa Stark : sighs.

Man : When we turned around she had gone, My Lady. She was nothing. Some winter town girl.

Man : She comes in asking for Ser Rodrick and Maester Llewyn.

Man : Don't trouble yourself over it, My Lady. We'll find her.

Sansa Stark : You don't have to. I know where she is.

Arya Stark : is standing look at a statue of Ned Stark holding his sword. ARYA hears a sound and turns to see SANSA approaching. SANSA stops when she sees ARYA.

Arya Stark : Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?

Sansa Stark : hesitates for a moment.

Sansa Stark : Yes.

Sansa Stark : begins smiling then walking towards ARYA. SANSA reaches out and hugs ARYA.

Sansa Stark : You shouldn't have run from the guards.

Arya Stark : I didn't run. You need better guards.

Sansa Stark : smirks at ARYA.

Arya Stark : It suits you, Lady Stark. Jon left you in charge?

Sansa Stark : He did. I hope he comes back soon. I remember how happy he was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop.

Arya Stark : That doesn't look like him. It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.

Sansa Stark : Everyone who knew his face is dead.

Arya Stark : We're not.

Arya Stark : turns to face SANSA.

Arya Stark : They say you killed Joffrey. Did you?

Sansa Stark : I wish I had.

Arya Stark : Me too. I was angry when I heard someone else had done it. However long my list got he was always first.

Sansa Stark : Your list?

Arya Stark : Of people I'm going to kill.

Sansa Stark : begins to laugh. ARYA joins her.

Sansa Stark : How did you get back to Winterfell?

Arya Stark : It's a long story. I imagine yours is too.

Sansa Stark : Yes. It's not a very pleasant one.

Arya Stark : Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet.

Sansa Stark : No, they're not.

Sansa Stark : Arya, Bran's home too.

Arya Stark : smiles and looks at SANSA. SANSA doesn't smile back. The smile fades from ARYA's face.

Bran Stark : is sitting next to the Weirwood tree. SANSA and ARYA approach. BRAN turns to look at them. BRAN begins speaking to ARYA.

Bran Stark : You came home.

Arya Stark : steps forward and throws her arms around BRAN. SANSA smiles in the background. ARYA lets go and steps back.

Bran Stark : I saw you at the crossroads.

Arya Stark : You saw me?

Bran Stark : I see quite a lot now.

Sansa Stark : Bran has visions.

Bran Stark : I thought you might go to King's Landing.

Arya Stark : So did I.

Sansa Stark : Why would you go back there?

Bran Stark : Cersei is on her list of names.

Arya Stark : stares at BRAN. ARYA turns to look at SANSA.

Sansa Stark : Who else is on your list?

Arya Stark : Most of them are dead already.

Bran Stark : produces the Valyrian dagger that BAELISH gave him and unsheathes it.

Arya Stark : Where did you get this?

Bran Stark : Littlefinger gave it to me.

Arya Stark : Littlefinger, he's here?

Arya Stark : turns to look at SANSA.

Sansa Stark : He's declared for House Stark.

Sansa Stark : steps up closer to BRAN and speaks to him.

Sansa Stark : Why would he give you a dagger?

Bran Stark : He thought I'd want it.

Sansa Stark : Why?

Bran Stark : Because it was meant to kill me.

Sansa Stark : The cutthroat after your fall?

Arya Stark : Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?

Bran Stark : Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.

Sansa Stark : He's not a generous man. He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.

Bran Stark : It doesn't matter.

Sansa Stark : What do you mean it doesn't matter?

Bran Stark : I don't want it.

Bran Stark : holds the knife out to ARYA. ARYA looks at BRAN.

Arya Stark : Are you sure? It's Valyrian steel.

Bran Stark : It's wasted on a cripple.

Arya Stark : looks down at the dagger. She steps forward and takes it from BRAN.

Arya Stark : is pushing BRAN in his wheelchair and SANSA is next to them. The Stark children are walking back through the gate of Winterfell. Men are milling around doing various jobs. BRIENNE and PODRICK see the Stark children all back at Winterfell together.

Podrick : Catelyn Stark would be proud. You kept your vow.

Brienne : I did next to nothing.

Podrick : You're too hard on yourself, My Lady.

Brienne : I'm not a --

Brienne : pauses for a moment.

Brienne : Thank you, Podrick.

Daenerys Targaryen : and MISSANDEI are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard.

Missandei : Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied.

Daenerys Targaryen : Soon. They will come back to me.

Missandei : He better.

Daenerys Targaryen : stops and turns to look at MISSANDEI. She then continues walking.

Daenerys Targaryen : What happened?

Missandei : begins smirking.

Missandei : Many things.

Daenerys Targaryen : Many things?

Jon Snow : Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard. She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down.

Daenerys Targaryen : It's all right.

Daenerys Targaryen : descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON. They walk along the beach until they reach a cave. DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.

Jon Snow : I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.

Jon Snow : leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave. He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls. He continues walking deeper into the cave.

Jon Snow : So this is it, all we'll ever need.

Daenerys Targaryen : is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass.

Jon Snow : There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace.

Jon Snow : and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.

Jon Snow : The Children of the Forest made these.

Daenerys Targaryen : When?

Jon Snow : A very long time ago.

Daenerys Targaryen : They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men.

Jon Snow : No.

Daenerys Targaryen : stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON. JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals. The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.

Jon Snow : They were here together the Children and the First Men.

Daenerys Targaryen : Doing what? Fighting each other?

Jon Snow : takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.

Daenerys Targaryen : They fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive.

Jon Snow : and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.

Jon Snow : Because the enemy is real. It's always been real.

Daenerys Targaryen : turns to look at JON.

Daenerys Targaryen : And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?

Jon Snow : No, I don't think I can.

Daenerys Targaryen : steps forward closer to JON.

Daenerys Targaryen : I will fight for you. I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.

Jon Snow : My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered.

Daenerys Targaryen : steps even closer to JON until they're face to face.

Daenerys Targaryen : They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?

Jon Snow : and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion.

Daenerys Targaryen : What is it?

Tyrion Lannister : We took Casterly Rock.

Daenerys Targaryen : That's very good to hear.

Tyrion Lannister : and VARYS look at each other. They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.

Daenerys Targaryen : Isn't it?

Davos : You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves. Perhaps --

Daenerys Targaryen : You will stay. All my allies are gone. They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.

Tyrion Lannister : We still have the largest army.

Daenerys Targaryen : Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.

Tyrion Lannister : Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan.

Daenerys Targaryen : stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion.

Daenerys Targaryen : The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach.

Tyrion Lannister : If I've underestimated our enemies --

Daenerys Targaryen : Our enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.

Daenerys Targaryen : begins looking out to the ocean. Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.

Daenerys Targaryen : Enough with the clever plans.

Daenerys Targaryen : turns back and looks at TYRION.

Daenerys Targaryen : I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.

Tyrion Lannister : We've discussed this.

Daenerys Targaryen : My enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?

Tyrion Lannister : A smart one.

Daenerys Targaryen : looks over to JON SNOW.

Daenerys Targaryen : What do you think I should do?

Jon Snow : I would never presume to --

Daenerys Targaryen : I'm at war. I'm losing.

Daenerys Targaryen : begins walking close to JON.

Jon Snow : looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.

Jon Snow : I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.

Jon Snow : glances back towards the dragons.

Jon Snow : But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same.

Daenerys Targaryen : looks back out to her dragons flying along the water.

Brienne : and PODRICK are sparring. BRIENNE kicks PODS foot out from under him and he lands face first in the dirt.

Brienne : Don't lunge.

Podrick : pushes himself back up and picks up his sword. PODRICK attacks again. Brienne blocks his blows and kicks his foot out again.

Brienne : Don't go where your enemy leads you.

Arya Stark : is watching the sparring session from across the courtyard. She begins to approach Brienne.

Brienne : Up.

Brienne : begins striking at PODRICK while he blocks her blows. BRIENNE hits PODRICK in the stomach with the hilt of her sword and PODRICK lands on the ground.

Brienne : And don't --

Arya Stark : Don't fight someone like her in the first place.

Podrick : stands up and retrieves his sword. ARYA walks closer to speak to BRIENNE.

Brienne : Nice sword. Very nice dagger.

Arya Stark : looks down at the Valyrian dagger and unsheathes it. She approaches BRIENNE flipping the knife several times in her fingers. BRIENNE takes the dagger and examines it.

Sansa Stark : and BAELISH are walking along the upper section of the courtyard having a conversation.

Sansa Stark : If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --

Sansa Stark : sees ARYA in the courtyard speaking with BRIENNE and stops to watch her.

Arya Stark : It's been awhile since I've trained.

Brienne : I can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady.

Arya Stark : He didn't beat the hound. You did. I want to train with you.

Brienne : chuckles.

Arya Stark : You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?

Brienne : nods her head in agreement.

Brienne : Move aside, Podrick.

Podrick : backs away. ARYA draws her sword, Needle.

Brienne : You can't use that, My Lady. It's too small.

Arya Stark : I won't cut you. Don't worry.

Brienne : smirks and raises her sword to a fighting posture.

Brienne : I'll try not to.

Brienne : strikes at ARYA who quickly sidesteps and parries the attack. BRIENNE attacks again and ARYA sidesteps, dodges multiple strikes and parries BRIENNE while smiling. ARYA strikes at BRIENNE and hits her hand causing BRIENNE to flinch and lose her two-handed grip on her sword. BRIENNE regains composure and starts to circle ARYA. BAELISH and SANSA are still watching from the upper balcony. ARYA is waiting for an attack with her sword behind her back. BRIENNE strikes and ARYA blocks her attacks, spins and stabs behind her back and hits BRIENNE in the knee causing BRIENNE's sword to strike the dirt. BRIENNE kicks ARYA in the stomach and sends ARYA to the ground. ARYA quickly gets back to her feet. BRIENNE overpowers ARYA and ARYA drops her sword on the ground. BRIENNE strikes again but ARYA dodges, draws her Valyrian dagger and puts it near BRIENNE's neck. BRIENNE and ARYA both stop fighting and sheathe their weapons smiling.

Brienne : Who taught you to do that?

Arya Stark : No one.

Arya Stark : collects her sword. SANSA walks away. BAELISH remains on the balcony staring at ARYA who looks up at him. BAELISH bows to ARYA and walks away.

Jon Snow : and DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion.

Davos : What do you think of her?

Jon Snow : Who?

Davos : sighs

Davos : I believe you know of whom I speak.

Jon Snow : I think she has a good heart.

Davos : A good heart? I've noticed you starring at that good heart.

Jon Snow : There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?

Davos : Fewer.

Jon Snow : What?

Davos : and JON near the end of the path. MISSANDEI is standing along the path looking at the ocean.

Davos : Speaking of good hearts, Missandei of Naarth.

Missandei : turns to looks at DAVOS and JON.

Missandei : Ser Davos, Lord Snow.

Davos : King Snow, isn't it? No? That doesn't sound right. King Jon?

Jon Snow : It doesn't matter.

Missandei : Forgive me, but may I ask a question?

Jon Snow : Of course.

Missandei : Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?

Jon Snow : I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married.

Davos : Is the custom different in Naarth?

Missandei : We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.

Davos : The sounds liberating.

Jon Snow : Why did you leave your homeland?

Missandei : I was stolen away by slavers.

Jon Snow : I'm sorry.

Davos : If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?

Missandei : She bought me from my master and set me free.

Davos : That was good of her. Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?

Missandei : I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen. Because I believe in her.

Jon Snow : And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --

Missandei : Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.

Jon Snow : You believe that?

Missandei : I know it. All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her. She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew. She's the queen we chose.

Davos : You'll forgive me if I switch sides.

Jon Snow : notices a single ship sailing into the bay. It has a kraken sigil. MISSANDEI turns to look.

Jon Snow : Is that a Greyjoy ship?

Theon Greyjoy : GREYJOY and other Iron Born are pulling their landing boat onto the beach wading through the surf. They pull the boat onto the sand. JON SNOW, MISSANDEI, DAVOS and Dothraki guards are waiting to meet them. JON sees THEON and both men freeze and stare at each other. JON steps forward towards THEON.

Theon Greyjoy : Jon. I didn't know you were here.

Theon Greyjoy : steps closer to JON.

Theon Greyjoy : Sansa, is she all right?

Jon Snow : grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face.

Jon Snow : What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.

Jon Snow : releases THEON.

Davos : We heard your uncle attacked your fleet. We thought you were dead.

Theon Greyjoy : I should be.

Davos : Your sister?

Theon Greyjoy : Euron has her. I came to ask the queen to help get her back.

Jon Snow : The queen is gone.

Theon Greyjoy : Where did she go?

Randyll : All of the gold is safely through the gates of King's Landing.

Jaime Lannister : Good.

Randyll : We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall. If the head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time.

Jaime Lannister : We are stretched a bit thin.

Randyll : With your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility.

Jaime Lannister : Let's give them fair warning first. These men fought well at Highgarden.

Randyll : is clearly disappointed. He turns and rides off back to the line of soldiers. JAIME and BRONN exchange glances, then follow RANDYLL. BRONN and JAIME are riding through the ranks. DICKON TARLEY sees JAIME and starts a conversation.

Dickon : Ser Jaime.

Jaime Lannister : Rickon.

Dickon : Dickon.

Bronn : openly laughs in DICKON's face and looks at JAIME.

Jaime Lannister : I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden. Your first battle?

Dickon : nods his head in agreement.

Jaime Lannister : And?

Dickon : It was glorious.

Bronn : Come on. Your father's not here.

Dickon : All my life we've been pledged to House Tyrell. I knew some of those men. I hunted with them.

Jaime Lannister : They didn't deserve to die. But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl. So here we are.

Dickon : I didn't expect it to smell like that.

Bronn : Men shit themselves when they die. Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?

Jaime Lannister : looks over at BRONN

Bronn : Well, I learned it when I was 5.

Bronn : pauses and strains to hear a noise far in the distance.

Jaime Lannister : What?

Bronn : Listen.

Jaime Lannister : Spears and shields! Spears and shields!

Jaime Lannister : Spears and shields!

Bronn : In line now!

Randyll : is riding across the battlefield yelling orders to men.

Randyll : Come on, lads. Not those wagons. Fall in line. Fall in line.

Dickon : draws his sword. RANDYLL is yelling orders to the men.

Randyll : Spears armed!

Bronn : Get back to King's Landing.

Jaime Lannister : I'm not abandoning my army.

Bronn : You're a commander, not a damned infantryman. These fuckers are about to swamp us.

Jaime Lannister : We can hold them off.

Daenerys Targaryen : Dracarys!

Drogon : breathes fire into the first line of Lannister soldiers. The men burst into flames and start screaming. DICKON looks on in shock. A flanking group of Dothraki Screamers ride over the flames through the hole created by Drogon and start cutting men down. JAIME attempts to issue orders to the men.

Jaime Lannister : Hold the line!

Jaime Lannister : Archers! Archers with me!

Jaime Lannister : Knock!

Archers : Knock! Draw!

Drogon : loops around and is making a pass on JAIME and the archers. DAENERYS and DROGON are diving at the group of men.

Jaime Lannister : Loose!

Jaime Lannister : Qyburn's scorpion is over there.

Bronn : Go get it then.

Jaime Lannister : I can't shoot with one hand.

Jaime Lannister : holds up his gold hand to illustrate his point.

Bronn : hesitates for a moment. He turns his horse and rides to man the artillery crossbow. JAIME draws his sword and rides into battle.

Jaime Lannister : Come on!

Bronn : Where are you?

Tyrion Lannister : walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards. He can see Lannisters being slaughtered. One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak.

Guard : Your people can't fight.

Tyrion Lannister : is watching the mayhem. Men are screaming and engulfed in flames. Horses and carriages run wild with no driver. JAIME is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde. Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces. Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire. DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water. JAIME sees her approaching his position.

Jaime Lannister : Take cover!

Drogon : spits flames into the Lannister position. The men standing there are reduced to standing ash. The wind blows them away. BRONN is lining up DROGON in the sights of the crossbow. He reaches down and pulls the lever to fire. A bolt sails past DROGON and misses. BRONN reloads the machine. DROGON and DAENERYS circle around and dive on the crossbow. BRONN takes his time aiming his shot.

Bronn : Come on you fucker.

Daenerys Targaryen : commands DROGON to fire at the crossbow.

Tyrion Lannister : Flee, you idiot!

Jaime Lannister : looks at DAENERYS and readies himself. He spurs his horse onward.

Jaime Lannister : Come on, boy. Come on!

Jaime Lannister : grabs the spear as he rides by and brings it up to position. JAIME's horse is galloping full speed on the edge of the river kicking up water. TYRION is watching JAIME's attempt to kill DAENERYS.

Tyrion Lannister : You fucking idiot.

Jaime Lannister : is getting close. DAENERYS turns at the last moment to see JAIME bearing down on her spear in hand. DROGON notices JAIME, turns his head and spews flames. BRONN appears from nowhere and manages to dive off of his horse and knock JAIME and himself in the water before they're both consumed by fire. Their horses are instantly burned to death. JAIME is being dragged down by a full set of armor into the dark water. JAIME sinks into blackness and out of sight.

End : CREDITS

Jaime Lannister : You could have killed me.

Bronn : What the fuck were you doing back there?

Jaime Lannister : Ending the war by killing her.

Bronn : You saw the dragon between you and her?

Bronn : looks incredulously at JAIME.

Bronn : And?

Jaime Lannister : sits up and says nothing to BRONN. BRONN sits up and faces JAIME.

Bronn : Listen to me, cunt. Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you. You don't get to kill you. Only I get to kill you.

Jaime Lannister : That was only one of them. She has two more. If she decides to use them, to really use them --

Bronn : You're fucked.

Jaime Lannister : Don't you mean we're fucked?

Bronn : No, I do not. Dragons are where our partnership ends. I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing.

Jaime Lannister : I have to tell Cersei.

Bronn : pauses and looks at JAIME.

Bronn : Best well jump back in that river.

Bronn : stands up and walks away. JAIME continues sitting on the shore looking at the smoke and fire from the distant battle.

Tyrion Lannister : is walking over an ash covered ground. There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about. Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies. A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to where DAENERYS and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners. DAENERYS addresses the captured soldiers.

Daenerys Targaryen : I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --

Daenerys Targaryen : burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children. That's Cersei Lannister, not me. I'm not here to murder. And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die.

Daenerys Targaryen : Step forward, My Lord.

Randyll : takes several steps towards DAENERYS and stands in front of the kneeling Lannister men.

Daenerys Targaryen : You will not kneel?

Randyll : I already have a queen.

Tyrion Lannister : My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible.

Randyll : There are no easy choices in war. Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life. You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader. One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back.

Daenerys Targaryen : You will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that.

Tyrion Lannister : turns to speak to DAENERYS.

Tyrion Lannister : Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace. Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier. He would be invaluable at the Wall.

Randyll : You cannot send me to the Wall. You are not my queen.

Daenerys Targaryen : turns to look at her Dothraki escort. The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL. As the men are pulling RANDYLL away DICKON steps forward.

Dickon : You will have to kill me too.

Randyll : pulls away from the Dothraki and turns to face his son.

Randyll : Step back and shut your mouth.

Daenerys Targaryen : Who are you?

Randyll : A stupid boy.

Dickon : I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley.

Tyrion Lannister : You are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.

Dickon : looks to RANDYLL. RANDYLL nods to his son.

Dickon : I will not.

Tyrion Lannister : turns to speak to DAENERYS. He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell.

Daenerys Targaryen : I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --

Daenerys Targaryen : I'm not beheading anyone.

Tyrion Lannister : pauses and looks over the DROGON. DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace --

Daenerys Targaryen : looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal. The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON. RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm.

Daenerys Targaryen : Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die.

Daenerys Targaryen : pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON.

Daenerys Targaryen : Dracarys.

Drogon : draws a deep breath and begins spewing dragonfire at the two men. They are instantly engulfed in flames. They both collapse into ash after a few seconds. There are two craters left where RANDYLL and DICKON stood. The Lannister men recoil in horror. Any Lannister soldier that was still standing kneels to the ground. DAENERYS silently turns and begins to walk off the battlefield.

Jaime Lannister : is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEI's room. As he approaches, QYBURN exits the queen's chambers.

Qyburn : My Lord.

Jaime Lannister : passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges into CERSEI's quarters. CERSEI stand and walks over to JAIME.

Cersei Lannister : How many men did we lose?

Jaime Lannister : We haven't done a full counting.

Cersei Lannister : It's armies that win wars. We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries.

Jaime Lannister : shakes his head.

Cersei Lannister : They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be.

Jaime Lannister : I just saw the Dothraki fight. They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen. Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport. Her dragon burned a thousand wagons. Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you. They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them. This isn't a war we can win.

Cersei Lannister : So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered. And in her mind she's winning. What sort of offer do you think she'd make?

Cersei Lannister : turns and walks away from JAIME.

Cersei Lannister : Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.

Jaime Lannister : He didn't.

Cersei Lannister : You saw the crossbow, you saw his body.

Jaime Lannister : walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing.

Jaime Lannister : I'm not talking about father. Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.

Cersei Lannister : After all this time it still amazes me --

Jaime Lannister : It was Olenna. She confessed before she died.

Cersei Lannister : And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?

Jaime Lannister : After.

Cersei Lannister : And you believed her?

Jaime Lannister : If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth.

Cersei Lannister : looks away, then sits down.

Cersei Lannister : I shouldn't have listened to you. She should have died screaming.

Jaime Lannister : She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house. And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them.

Cersei Lannister : So we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice. A soldier should know his.

Jon Snow : SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away.

Daenerys Targaryen : They're beautiful, aren't they?

Jon Snow : That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts.

Daenerys Targaryen : They're not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children.

Daenerys Targaryen : turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance.

Jon Snow : You weren't gone long.

Daenerys Targaryen : turns back to JON.

Daenerys Targaryen : No.

Jon Snow : And?

Daenerys Targaryen : And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.

Jon Snow : pauses and doesn't say anything.

Daenerys Targaryen : You're not sure how you feel about that?

Jon Snow : No, I'm not.

Daenerys Targaryen : turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows.

Daenerys Targaryen : How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?

Jon Snow : Thousands.

Daenerys Targaryen : We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.

Jon Snow : Ser Davos gets carried away.

Daenerys Targaryen : So it was a figure of speech?

Jon Snow : doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.

Guard : This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : He is my friend.

Jorah Mormont : kneels before DAENERYS.

Jorah Mormont : Your Grace.

Jorah Mormont : stands.

Daenerys Targaryen : Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend.

Jon Snow : I served with your father. He was a great man.

Jorah Mormont : nods to JON.

Daenerys Targaryen : You look strong. You found a cure?

Jorah Mormont : I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me.

Daenerys Targaryen : It would be my honor.

Daenerys Targaryen : steps forward and hugs JORAH.

Bran Stark : s eyes are pure white. They wash back to their normal color. He is sitting in front of the Weirwood. Maester Wolkan stands next to him.

Bran Stark : Ravens. We need to send ravens.

Wolkan : nods his head to BRAN.

Archmaester : MARWYN and other citadel maesters are seated at a council table. MARWYN has a raven scroll in his hand and the maesters are discussing the contents. SAMWELL enters the room carrying a large stock of books and scrolls. MARWYN points SAM to a nearby table to offload the books.

Maester : I put very little stock in it myself. Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes.

Marwyn : I remember Wolkan. A bit timid but a sharp mind.

Maester : The north has dulled many good maester's wits. I'm not sure if it's the cold, the drink, or the company.

Maester : A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes.

Sam : stops working and turns around.

Marwyn : It is a bit much. Still we ought to --

Sam Tarly : Brandon Stark --

Sam Tarly : the crippled boy.

Marwyn : Do you know him?

Sam Tarly : I let him through the Wall years ago. I saw him go beyond the wall.

Marwyn : And?

Sam Tarly : Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could. Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one. Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say.

Maester : Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.

Marwyn : I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.

Sam Tarly : steps forward and clears his throat.

Sam Tarly : Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you. If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it. If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it. And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good.

Marwyn : It could be done. And this news could be authentic. It's possible. It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.

Maester : That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.

Sam Tarly : Archmaester, please. It's real. I've seen it.

Marwyn : We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification. I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.

Sam Tarly : Archmaester --

Marwyn : That will be all, Tarley.

Sam : turns to collect his work and leave. The maesters begin talking to one another.

Maester : It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest.

Maester : Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer.

Maester : Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?

Marwyn : I'm afraid so.

Maester : Horrible business.

Marwyn : I don't have the heart to tell him yet. He's a good lad.

Marwyn : crumples the raven scroll and throws it dismissevely on the table.

Marwyn : Right. The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...

Varys : and TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone. VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone. TYRION is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS.

Tyrion Lannister : All rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do?

Varys : Not burn him alive alongside his son.
