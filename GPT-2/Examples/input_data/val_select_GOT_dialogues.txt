Tyrion Lannister : I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her.

Tyrion Lannister : Daenerys is not her father.

Tyrion Lannister : looks down at the note in VARYS's hand.

Tyrion Lannister : Who is that for?

Tyrion Lannister : Did you read it?

Tyrion Lannister : pauses and drinks from his cup of wine.

Tyrion Lannister : What's it say?

Jon Snow : I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead.

Jon Snow : Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall --

Jon Snow : interrupts VARYS.

Jon Snow : I need to go home.

Jon Snow : We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us.

Tyrion Lannister : Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?

Jon Snow : I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.

Tyrion Lannister : begins walking around the table closer to JON.

Tyrion Lannister : So bring the dead to her.

Tyrion Lannister : We don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.

Jon Snow : The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.

Tyrion Lannister : Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.

Tyrion Lannister : The only person she listens to is Jaime. He may listen to me.

Tyrion Lannister : nods his head.

Jon Snow : pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence.

Jon Snow : The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.

Jon Snow : They won't have to.

Jon Snow : I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them.

Jon Snow : With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance.

Tyrion Lannister : Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.

Tyrion Lannister : turns to look at DAVOS. DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.

Tyrion Lannister : begins walking towards the path. DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead. TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.

Tyrion Lannister : You're not staying here?

Tyrion Lannister : What if someone takes the boat?

Tyrion Lannister : I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.

Tyrion Lannister : You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud.

Tyrion Lannister : Listen to me --

Tyrion Lannister : glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.

Tyrion Lannister : It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.

Tyrion Lannister : He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose --

Tyrion Lannister : Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.

Tyrion Lannister : I -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request.

Tyrion Lannister : Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.

Tyrion Lannister : He'll do.

Jon Snow : stops and turns around to face DAVOS.

Jon Snow : You survived King's Landing.

Jon Snow : Your Grace, this is --

Jon Snow : looks to DAVOS.

Jon Snow : I saw your father once at Winterfell.

Jon Snow : You're a lot leaner.

Jon Snow : stops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles.

Jon Snow : I grew up on stories about them.

Jon Snow : Do you know how to use one?

Jon Snow : Well, that's a problem.

Jon Snow : nods.

Jon Snow : We could use the help.

Tyrion Lannister : You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont. Nobody glowers quite like you. Not even Grey Worm.

Tyrion Lannister : retrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands.

Tyrion Lannister : This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us. Remember?

Tyrion Lannister : smiles and hands the coin to JORAH.

Tyrion Lannister : Take it with you. You'll bring it back. Our queen needs you.

Jon Snow : If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.

Jon Snow : I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace.

Jon Snow : Heave!

Jon Snow : and the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch. JON looks up at the castle. The men collect their equipment and make for the castle.

Jon Snow : Two.

Jon Snow : Both.

Jon Snow : looks around the table.

Jon Snow : Not enough.

Jon Snow : smiles and shakes his head. TORMUND is disappointed.

Jon Snow : You're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell.

Jon Snow : He's right. We're all on the same side.

Jon Snow : We're all breathing.

Jon Snow : Are you all right?

Jon Snow : Ever been north before?

Jon Snow : You've never been down south.

Jon Snow : That's the north.

Jon Snow : There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.

Jon Snow : glances at GENDRY. GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.

Jon Snow : Davos says he is a strong fighter.

Jon Snow : She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.

Jon Snow : The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.

Jon Snow : I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.

Jon Snow : I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.

Jon Snow : I heard.

Jon Snow : I'm glad he didn't capture you.

Jon Snow : stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.

Jon Snow : Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw.

Jon Snow : hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.

Jon Snow : Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.

Jon Snow : But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it.

Jon Snow : I'm not his son.

Jon Snow : Who's that?

Jon Snow : You knew him?

Jon Snow : I serve the north.

Jon Snow : The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.

Jon Snow : Why?

Jon Snow : That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants.

Jon Snow : So what are you fighting for?

Jon Snow : But we all die.

Jon Snow : I am the shield that guards the realms of men.

Jon Snow : Aye. Maybe that's enough.

Tyrion Lannister : is sitting in a chair staring into the fire. DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.

Tyrion Lannister : turns to look at DAENERYS.

Tyrion Lannister : I honestly don't.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh. I've been heroic on occasion.

Tyrion Lannister : I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.

Tyrion Lannister : It's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.

Jon Snow : How many people live here?

Tyrion Lannister : A million, give or take.

Jon Snow : That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?

Tyrion Lannister : There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.

Tyrion Lannister : I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world.

Tyrion Lannister : A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.

Tyrion Lannister : Supporting the enemy, no less.

Tyrion Lannister : Cersei will anyway.

Tyrion Lannister : Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

Tyrion Lannister : You've been thinking about our new queen.

Tyrion Lannister : Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk.

Tyrion Lannister : It's good to see you again.

Tyrion Lannister : You might.

Tyrion Lannister : And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.

Tyrion Lannister : She'll be here soon.

Tyrion Lannister : No.

Tyrion Lannister : We are all facing a unique

Tyrion Lannister : I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.

Tyrion Lannister : We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face.

Tyrion Lannister : We all know that will never happen.

Jon Snow : This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.

Jon Snow : This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.

Tyrion Lannister : There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.

Jon Snow : We can destroy them by burning them.

Jon Snow : And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world.

Jon Snow : There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.

Jon Snow : No.

Jon Snow : I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.

Jon Snow : I know!

Tyrion Lannister : I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen

Jon Snow : I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.

Tyrion Lannister : That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.

Tyrion Lannister : Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.

Jon Snow : I did this. I should go.

Tyrion Lannister : She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.

Tyrion Lannister : You spoke with her?

Tyrion Lannister : I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?

Tyrion Lannister : A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you.

Tyrion Lannister : I didn't know about that.

Tyrion Lannister : Cersei, I didn't know.

Tyrion Lannister : I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.

Tyrion Lannister : After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me.

Tyrion Lannister : I have never been more sorry about anything.

Tyrion Lannister : All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me.

Tyrion Lannister : If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father.

Tyrion Lannister : I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.

Tyrion Lannister : If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something.

Tyrion Lannister : Mm, not like this.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes.

Tyrion Lannister : Because I think she will make the world a better place.

Tyrion Lannister : She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.

Tyrion Lannister : You're pregnant.

Jon Snow : No one is less happy about this than I am.

Jon Snow : You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.

Jon Snow : Who told you that?

Jon Snow : Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?

Jon Snow : So, what now?

Jon Snow : It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.

Jon Snow : If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight.

Jon Snow : It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message.

Jon Snow : All right.

Jon Snow : We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.

Jon Snow : It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret.

Jon Snow : No. Not compared to you.

Jon Snow : Our father was more of a father.

Jon Snow : And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.

Jon Snow : But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.

Jon Snow : It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark.

Jon Snow : So, why are you still talking to me?

Tyrion Lannister : You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won't freeze off.

Tyrion Lannister : Because I have balls, and you don't.

Jon Snow : I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.

Jon Snow : Look at you.

Jon Snow : You're a man.

Jon Snow : Where's Arya?

Jon Snow : Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell.

Jon Snow : We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.

Jon Snow : It's not important.

Jon Snow : You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North.

Tyrion Lannister : If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause.

Tyrion Lannister : I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die.

Tyrion Lannister : My lord. My lady.

Tyrion Lannister : The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.

Tyrion Lannister : Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.

Tyrion Lannister : Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-

Tyrion Lannister : She did.

Tyrion Lannister : She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.

Jon Snow : How did you sneak up on me?

Jon Snow : I didn't.

Jon Snow : You still have it.

Jon Snow : Have you ever used it?

Jon Snow : Jealous?

Jon Snow : Where were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa.

Jon Snow : Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.

Jon Snow : Now you're defending her?

Jon Snow : You?

Jon Snow : Yeah. I'm her family too.

Tyrion Lannister : One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway.

Tyrion Lannister : And our queen is grateful.

Tyrion Lannister : I sense that you're leading to a proposal.

Tyrion Lannister : They do make a handsome couple.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not that old.

Tyrion Lannister : Not as old as him.

Tyrion Lannister : Our queen respects the wisdom of age.

Tyrion Lannister : What is that?

Jon Snow : She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up.

Jon Snow : What's the matter?

Jon Snow : What's wrong with them?

Jon Snow : I don't know how to ride a dragon.

Jon Snow : What if he doesn't want me to?

Jon Snow : What do I hold onto?

Jon Snow : You've completely ruined horses for me.

Jon Snow : We'd be pretty old.

Jon Snow : It's cold up here for a southern girl.

Jon Snow : House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years." Isn't that what he said?

Jon Snow : I told you we needed allies.

Jon Snow : I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons.

Jon Snow : Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance.

Jon Snow : Do you have any faith in me at all?

Jon Snow : She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.

Jon Snow : Sam?

Jon Snow : Were you hiding from me?

Jon Snow : What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?

Jon Snow : What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?

Jon Snow : Little Sam?

Jon Snow : Know what?

Jon Snow : I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.

Jon Snow : Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me.

Jon Snow : I wasn't a king.

Jon Snow : I gave up my crown, Sam.

Jon Snow : I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.

Jon Snow : What are you talking about?

Jon Snow : My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.

Jon Snow : Daenerys is our queen.

Jon Snow : That's treason.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace, I know my brother-

Tyrion Lannister : He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?

Jon Snow : We need every man we can get.

Tyrion Lannister : I was a fool.

Tyrion Lannister : I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, here we are.

Tyrion Lannister : Together again.

Tyrion Lannister : And the masses rejoice.

Tyrion Lannister : She's your new queen too.

Tyrion Lannister : They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.

Tyrion Lannister : She is.

Tyrion Lannister : I am.

Tyrion Lannister : It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.

Tyrion Lannister : Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.

Tyrion Lannister : Was she lying about the baby too?

Tyrion Lannister : She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway.

Tyrion Lannister : So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I wouldo ve chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-

Tyrion Lannister : My cock.

Tyrion Lannister : At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.

Tyrion Lannister : Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.

Jon Snow : I thought we'd lost you.

Jon Snow : How did you find each other?

Jon Snow : The Umbers?

Jon Snow : How long do we have?

Jon Snow : They're coming.

Jon Snow : We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.

Jon Snow : But there are too many of them.

Jon Snow : Far too many.

Jon Snow : Our enemy doesn't tire.

Jon Snow : Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.

Jon Snow : We can't beat them in a straight fight.

Jon Snow : The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.

Tyrion Lannister : How will he find you?

Jon Snow : We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest.

Tyrion Lannister : When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives.

Jon Snow : If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does.

Jon Snow : Let's get some rest.

Jon Snow : Your Grace.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you need help?

Tyrion Lannister : You've had a strange journey.

Tyrion Lannister : I'd like to hear about it.

Tyrion Lannister : If only we were trapped in a castle, in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go.

Jon Snow : No.

Jon Snow : Gilly? Little Sam?

Jon Snow : If you want to join them.

Jon Snow : To protect them.

Jon Snow : Now it's just us three.

Tyrion Lannister : I wish Father were here.

Tyrion Lannister : I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.

Tyrion Lannister : I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall.

Tyrion Lannister : You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.

Tyrion Lannister : I was speaking in relative terms.

Tyrion Lannister : Of course I miss it.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not. Things would be easier if it were.

Tyrion Lannister : The perils of self-betterment.

Tyrion Lannister : To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.

Tyrion Lannister : And you?

Tyrion Lannister : Ser Davos, join us.

Tyrion Lannister : Would you like a drink?

Tyrion Lannister : It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together.

Tyrion Lannister : I think we might live.

Tyrion Lannister : I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.

Tyrion Lannister : Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke.

Tyrion Lannister : Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne.

Tyrion Lannister : Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!

Tyrion Lannister : No, let's stay a bit longer.

Tyrion Lannister : How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?

Tyrion Lannister : Ser Brienne?

Tyrion Lannister : Mmm.

Jon Snow : Lyanna Stark.

Jon Snow : He didn't. He loved her.

Jon Snow : They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard.

Jon Snow : My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.

Jon Snow : I wish it were.

Jon Snow : Bran. He saw it.

Jon Snow : And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.

Jon Snow : It's true, Dany. I know it is.

Jon Snow : The Night King is coming.

Jon Snow : Dany!

Tyrion Lannister : If we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing. Something that makes a difference.

Tyrion Lannister : What? Remember the Battle of Blackwater? I brought us through the Mud Gate.

Tyrion Lannister : And it made a difference. If I was out there right now...

Tyrion Lannister : You might be surprised at the lengths I'd go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead. I could think of no organization less suited to my talents.

Tyrion Lannister : Maybe we should have stayed married.

Tyrion Lannister : What a terrifying thought.

Tyrion Lannister : Why not?

Jon Snow : Get off!

Tyrion Lannister : Come on! Come on! No! No, no, no!

Jon Snow : Bran!

Jon Snow : We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.

Tyrion Lannister : A fitting reward for a hero.

Tyrion Lannister : And a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm sure you had your reasons.

Tyrion Lannister : So did you?

Tyrion Lannister : I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.

Tyrion Lannister : Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with.

Tyrion Lannister : This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.

Tyrion Lannister : You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.

Tyrion Lannister : You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.

Tyrion Lannister : You don't want it.

Tyrion Lannister : I envy you.

Jon Snow : Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?

Jon Snow : She shouldn't be alone.

Jon Snow : Aren't you worried for her?

Jon Snow : We're not much for riddles where I'm from.

Jon Snow : That's her decision to make. She is our queen.

Jon Snow : What do you want?

Jon Snow : I don't want it. I never have.

Jon Snow : She is my queen.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace?

Tyrion Lannister : There's something you need to know.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes.

Tyrion Lannister : Varys.

Tyrion Lannister : He does.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.

Tyrion Lannister : It was a mistake.

Tyrion Lannister : She trusts me.

Tyrion Lannister : If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone.

Tyrion Lannister : But it doesn't matter now.

Tyrion Lannister : It was me.

Jon Snow : I don't want it, and that's what I told him.

Jon Snow : I love you. And you will always be my queen.

Tyrion Lannister : The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen.

Tyrion Lannister : They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.

Tyrion Lannister : What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.

Tyrion Lannister : I beg you, my queen-

Tyrion Lannister : Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.

Tyrion Lannister : She wants to attack now.

Jon Snow : Daybreak at the earliest.

Tyrion Lannister : Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?

Tyrion Lannister : I drink to eat the skull keeper.

Tyrion Lannister : I want to eat the skull keeper.

Tyrion Lannister : I want to see the ...

Tyrion Lannister : Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.

Tyrion Lannister : Ordered by whom? The queen herself?

Tyrion Lannister : Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot.

Tyrion Lannister : How did they find you?

Tyrion Lannister : Did you consider taking it off?

Tyrion Lannister : And you're going back to her, to die with her.

Tyrion Lannister : She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.

Tyrion Lannister : Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise.

Tyrion Lannister : You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.

Tyrion Lannister : She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be.

Tyrion Lannister : The city will fall tomorrow.

Tyrion Lannister : I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.

Tyrion Lannister : Why?

Tyrion Lannister : Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life.

Tyrion Lannister : There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again.

Tyrion Lannister : Swear to me.

Tyrion Lannister : If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.

Tyrion Lannister : I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.

Tyrion Lannister : If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible.

Tyrion Lannister : Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never wouldo ve survived my childhood.

Tyrion Lannister : You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.

Tyrion Lannister : If you hear the bells ring, they've surrendered. Call off your men.

Jon Snow : Move, move!

Jon Snow : No! Get back! Get back!

Jon Snow : Stay! Stay!

Jon Snow : Stop!

Jon Snow : Find somewhere to hide.

Jon Snow : We need to fall back! Fall back behind the wall! Fall back!

Jon Snow : Get out of the city! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back!

Tyrion Lannister : I'll find you later.

Jon Snow : It's not safe. Let me send some men with you.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm going alone.

Jon Snow : Grey Worm!

Jon Snow : It's over.

Jon Snow : And what are the queen's commands?

Tyrion Lannister : I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.

Jon Snow : What are you doing here?

Jon Snow : Hey, what happened?

Jon Snow : She's everyone's queen now.

Jon Snow : Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.

Tyrion Lannister : Did you bring any wine?

Jon Snow : No.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, "See, I told you." It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going.

Tyrion Lannister : So is there life after death?

Jon Snow : Not that I've seen.

Tyrion Lannister : I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.

Jon Snow : You didn't.

Tyrion Lannister : I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not.

Jon Snow : I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.

Tyrion Lannister : Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?

Tyrion Lannister : She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.

Jon Snow : And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today.

Tyrion Lannister : Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.

Jon Snow : You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister : My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.

Jon Snow : Cersei left her no choice.

Tyrion Lannister : The moment the gates fell, the battle was over.

Jon Snow : She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.

Tyrion Lannister : And she burned down a city for it.

Jon Snow : Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield.

Tyrion Lannister : Would you have done it?

Jon Snow : What?

Tyrion Lannister : You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?

Jon Snow : I don't know.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know.

Jon Snow : What's it matter what I'd do?

Tyrion Lannister : It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men.

Tyrion Lannister : When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?

Tyrion Lannister : I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.

Jon Snow : Love is the death of duty.

Tyrion Lannister : You just came up with that?

Jon Snow : Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.

Tyrion Lannister : Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?

Tyrion Lannister : It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?

Jon Snow : That's her decision. She is the queen.

Jon Snow : I'm sorry it came to this.

Tyrion Lannister : And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?

Jon Snow : My sisters will be loyal to the throne.

Tyrion Lannister : Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.

Jon Snow : She doesn't get to choose.

Tyrion Lannister : No. But you do. And you have to choose now.

Jon Snow : I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.

Jon Snow : Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!

Jon Snow : And Tyrion?

Jon Snow : Forgive him.

Jon Snow : You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand.

Jon Snow : Please, Dany.

Jon Snow : The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.

Jon Snow : How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?

Jon Snow : I don't.

Jon Snow : What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.

Jon Snow : You are my queen. Now, and always.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not for you to decide.

Tyrion Lannister : You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.

Tyrion Lannister : You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.

Tyrion Lannister : Me? The Imp?

Tyrion Lannister : Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her.

Tyrion Lannister : Can't think of a worse choice.

Tyrion Lannister : I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.

Tyrion Lannister : What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?

Tyrion Lannister : Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break.

Tyrion Lannister : From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm.

Tyrion Lannister : I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?

Tyrion Lannister : To Brandon of House Stark... I say aye.

Tyrion Lannister : All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.

Tyrion Lannister : N- No, Your Grace, I don't want it.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else.

Tyrion Lannister : Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.

Jon Snow : There's still a Night's Watch?

Tyrion Lannister : The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.

Tyrion Lannister : You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose.

Jon Snow : Was it right? What I did?

Tyrion Lannister : What we did.

Jon Snow : It doesn't feel right.

Tyrion Lannister : Ask me again in ten years.

Jon Snow : I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.

Tyrion Lannister : I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.

Jon Snow : The North is free, thanks to you.

Jon Snow : Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for.

Jon Snow : You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black.

Jon Snow : You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?

Jon Snow : You have your Needle?

Jon Snow : Your Grace.

Jon Snow : I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.

Tyrion Lannister : That's not- Uh-

Tyrion Lannister : What's this?

Tyrion Lannister : I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, he's kind to me. Never wouldo ve guessed.

Tyrion Lannister : He's not kind?

Tyrion Lannister : He what? What does he say about me?

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks.

Tyrion Lannister : As you wish, Your Grace.

Tyrion Lannister : We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign.

Tyrion Lannister : That will improve.

Tyrion Lannister : Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?

Tyrion Lannister : Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?

Tyrion Lannister : Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair.

Tyrion Lannister : Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population.

Tyrion Lannister : Find the best builders and set them to the task.

Tyrion Lannister : I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
