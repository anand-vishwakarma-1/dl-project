Tyrion Lannister : I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her.

Varys : That's what I used to tell myself about her father. I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive. I was only a purveyor of information.

Varys : reaches over to TYRION's cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it. He grimaces as he drinks.

Varys : It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, "I'm not the one doing it." As the pitch of their screams rose higher, "I'm not the one doing it." When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, "I'm not the one doing it."

Varys : drinks again and sets the cup down next to TYRION. TYRION picks it up.

Tyrion Lannister : Daenerys is not her father.

Varys : And she never will be... with the right counsel. You need to find a way to make her listen.

Tyrion Lannister : looks down at the note in VARYS's hand.

Tyrion Lannister : Who is that for?

Varys : Jon Snow.

Tyrion Lannister : Did you read it?

Varys : It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.

Tyrion Lannister : pauses and drinks from his cup of wine.

Tyrion Lannister : What's it say?

Varys : Nothing good.

Daenerys Targaryen : and VARYS are seated at the painted table. TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen. DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table. JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.

Jon Snow : I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead.

Daenerys Targaryen : I'm happy for you. You don't look happy.

Jon Snow : Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall --

Varys : The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years. Presumably --

Jon Snow : interrupts VARYS.

Jon Snow : I need to go home.

Daenerys Targaryen : You said you don't have enough men.

Jon Snow : We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us.

Daenerys Targaryen : And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in.

Tyrion Lannister : Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?

Jon Snow : I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.

Tyrion Lannister : begins walking around the table closer to JON.

Tyrion Lannister : So bring the dead to her.

Daenerys Targaryen : I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.

Tyrion Lannister : We don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.

Davos : Is that possible?

Jon Snow : The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.

Tyrion Lannister : Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.

Varys : Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.

Tyrion Lannister : The only person she listens to is Jaime. He may listen to me.

Daenerys Targaryen : And how would you get into King's Landing.

Davos : I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter.

Tyrion Lannister : nods his head.

Daenerys Targaryen : Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men.

Varys : Fair point. How do you propose to find one?

Jon Snow : pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence.

Jorah Mormont : With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.

Daenerys Targaryen : turns to look at JORAH.

Jorah Mormont : You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you. Allow me to serve you.

Jon Snow : The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.

Davos : They won't follow Ser Jorah.

Jon Snow : They won't have to.

Davos : You can't lead a raid beyond the wall. You're not in the Night's Watch anymore. You're King in the North.

Jon Snow : I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them.

Daenerys Targaryen : I haven't given you permission to leave.

Jon Snow : With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance.

Daenerys Targaryen : pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement.

Robett : The King in the North should stay in the north. We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have.

Yohn : The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark.

Sansa Stark : You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king. He is doing what he thinks is best.

Sansa Stark : and ARYA are walking through the hall to SANSA's quarters having a discussion.

Sansa Stark : I warned Jon this would happen. He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.

Arya Stark : He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.

Sansa Stark : Well, he's not making it easy. The northern lords are proud.

Arya Stark : These are mother and father's chambers.

Sansa Stark : And?

Arya Stark : Nothing.

Sansa Stark : Don't do that.

Sansa Stark : turns around to face ARYA.

Arya Stark : What?

Sansa Stark : Say what you mean.

Arya Stark : You always liked nice things. It made you feel better than everyone.

Sansa Stark : drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA.

Sansa Stark : Are you angry with me?

Arya Stark : They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.

Sansa Stark : I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell.

Arya Stark : Their opinions are important to you?

Sansa Stark : Glover has 500 men. Royce has 2,000. Offend them and Jon loses his army.

Arya Stark : Not if they lose their heads first.

Sansa Stark : Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands. We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together. Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together.

Arya Stark : And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want.

Sansa Stark : How can you even think such a horrible thing?

Arya Stark : You're thinking it right now. You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away.

Sansa Stark : and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment.

Sansa Stark : I have work to do.

Sansa Stark : turns and walks away from ARYA.

Arya Stark : My lady.

Arya Stark : exits the room.

Davos : and TYRION are standing on the beach of King's Landing. DAVOS is securing a small row boat. TYRION is looking up towards the city walls.

Tyrion Lannister : Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.

Davos : Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.

Tyrion Lannister : turns to look at DAVOS. DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.

Davos : There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff. The guards hardly ever patrol it. Too many steps.

Tyrion Lannister : begins walking towards the path. DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead. TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.

Tyrion Lannister : You're not staying here?

Davos : I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.

Tyrion Lannister : What if someone takes the boat?

Davos : Then we're fucked. Best hurry.

Bronn : and JAIME are walking by the dragon skulls. Both men have sparring swords in their hand.

Jaime Lannister : We don't have time for this. We should be preparing the city for a siege. The Dothraki are coming.

Bronn : All the more reason for you to train. Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.

Jaime Lannister : I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.

Bronn : And here I am ready to train.

Jaime Lannister : Why down here?

Bronn : I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.

Jaime Lannister : Today might be the day I kill you by accident.

Bronn : Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.

Bronn : stops walking and holds his torch out. TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME. JAIME looks angrily at BRONN.

Bronn : I'll leave you to it.

Bronn : turns and walks away leaving JAIME and TYRION alone.

Tyrion Lannister : I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.

Jaime Lannister : remains silent and stares at TYRION.

Tyrion Lannister : You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud.

Jaime Lannister : Don't talk about our father.

Tyrion Lannister : Listen to me --

Jaime Lannister : I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.

Tyrion Lannister : glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.

Tyrion Lannister : It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.

Jaime Lannister : shakes his head and says nothing.

Tyrion Lannister : He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose --

Jaime Lannister : What do you want?

Tyrion Lannister : Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.

Jaime Lannister : You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.

Tyrion Lannister : I -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request.

Davos : I wasn't sure I'd find you.

Davos : I thought you might still be rowing.

Gendry Baratheon : chuckles and DAVOS smiles.

Davos : I looked in shops, taverns, brothels. I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.

Gendry Baratheon : Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?

Davos : I haven't been here in years. Why should they recognize me? Sometimes I hardly do. Nothing fucks you harder than time.

Davos : walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords. He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place. He turns back to GENDRY.

Davos : Anybody give you any trouble?

Gendry Baratheon : Here I am arming Lannisters. I never get a second look. You were right. Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.

Davos : Don't be so sure. Safety is never a permanent state of affairs. Bad things are coming.

Gendry Baratheon : nods.

Gendry Baratheon : You came to get me. You want me to come with you.

Davos : I think you need to understand --

Gendry Baratheon : I'm ready. Let's go.

Davos : You should know what you're heading into.

Gendry Baratheon : Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father? They tried to kill me.

Gendry Baratheon : is tossing his tools and apron to the side. He picks up a satchel and swings it over his head.

Gendry Baratheon : I've been getting ready. I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes.

Davos : You might want to bring one of those swords.

Gendry Baratheon : smiles at DAVOS and begins walking towards the weapons.

Gendry Baratheon : I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --

Gendry Baratheon : removes a giant war hammer from the wall.

Gendry Baratheon : this I know.

Gendry Baratheon : and DAVOS turn and walk out of the shop.

Davos : and GENDRY are walking towards the boat DAVOS left on the beach.

Davos : Keep your father's name to yourself. The situation is complicated enough already.

Gendry Baratheon : and DAVOS arrive at the boat. GENDRY lays his hammer on top of the boat cargo. DAVOS is gathering the anchor and rope. Two Goldcloaks begin walking down the beach towards the boat unnoticed by DAVOS and GENDRY.

Gendry Baratheon : Who should I say I am?

Davos : turns and notices the two guards approaching the boat. He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY.

Davos : I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --

Guard : You there.

Davos : No weapons, friends. I promise. What can I do for you?

Guard : Is that your boat?

Davos : It is.

Gendry Baratheon : looks down into the boat and sees his weapon in plain view.

Guard : The docks are that way.

Gendry Baratheon : That they are. I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.

Davos : Still five gold dragons?

Guard : Are you joking?

Guard : You must be even older than you look. 15.

Davos : 15?

Guard : Apiece.

Davos : angrily reaches into his pouch and pays the men.

Davos : I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.

Davos : turns and begins walking back to his boat.

Guard : What's in the boat?

Davos : pauses and turns back to the guards.

Davos : Not more gold.

Guard : Wine?

Guard : Mmm.

Guard : I like wine.

Guard : Or hams.

Davos : Come and have a look.

Davos : Fermented crab.

Guard : What?

Davos : Fermented crab. One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week. A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth. Five minutes later, he's back in the race. Here, have a taste.

Davos : scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards. Both men reach out and take a pinch. The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth. They both recoil from the taste and look at each other.

Davos : I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.

Guard : Oi, Dwarf!

Davos : quickly walks to cut the guards off.

Davos : I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.

Guard : That dwarf --

Guard : Where did you get that scar?

Tyrion Lannister : Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.

Guard : We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back.

Davos : is still standing behind the guards. He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it.

Davos : Perhaps there's some arrangement?

Guard : Arrangement? You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?

Gendry Baratheon : can be seen behind the backs of the guards. He slowly retrieves his hammer and creeps up behind GUARD 2. He swings his hammer and connects with the side of the guardo s head. The man drops. As GENDRY transitions onto the second guard and swings his hammer, GUARD 1 turns to look and catches a hammer blow to the face.

Davos : is looking at TYRION and motions towards GENDRY.

Davos : This is Gendry.

Tyrion Lannister : He'll do.

Jaime Lannister : opens the door and step into the queen's room. CERSEI is seated near a window speaking to QYBURN.

Cersei Lannister : That won't be necessary.

Qyburn : bows his head and walks to leave the room. As he passes by JAIME he addresses him.

Qyburn : Ser Jaime.

Qyburn : closes the door as he leaves. JAIME and CERSEI are alone. CERSEI begins walking over to a chair in front of JAIME and sits.

Jaime Lannister : Why was QYBURN here?

Cersei Lannister : He's Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?

Jaime Lannister : I met with Tyrion.

Cersei Lannister : pauses for a moment making JAIME uncomfortable.

Cersei Lannister : What did our brother have to say?

Jaime Lannister : Daenerys wants to meet.

Cersei Lannister : To discuss a surrender?

Jaime Lannister : To discuss an armistice.

Cersei Lannister : She just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?

Jaime Lannister : Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion claims he'll have proof.

Cersei Lannister : smirks and looks away from JAIME.

Cersei Lannister : Are you going to punish him?

Jaime Lannister : Tyrion?

Cersei Lannister : Bronn.

Jaime Lannister : looks confused.

Cersei Lannister : He betrayed you. He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent. Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?

Jaime Lannister : You let it happen. Why?

Cersei Lannister : I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest. She has the numbers. If we want to beat her we have to be clever. We have to fight her like father would have. Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house. For this.

Cersei Lannister : lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating she's pregnant. JAIME looks shocked.

Jaime Lannister : Who will you say is the father?

Cersei Lannister : You.

Jaime Lannister : People won't like that.

Cersei Lannister : stands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME.

Cersei Lannister : Do you remember what father used to say about people?

Jaime Lannister : The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.

Jaime Lannister : reaches forward and takes CERSEI and kisses her. While they embrace CERSEI speaks to JAIME.

Cersei Lannister : Never betray me again.

Gendry Baratheon : and DAVOS are walking down the beach near the Dragonglass cave. Groups of men are carrying boxes filled with Dragonglass out of the cave. DAVOS and GENDRY are having a discussion.

Davos : We're leaving today. The king's got a lot on his mind.

Gendry Baratheon : I understand.

Davos : He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.

Gendry Baratheon : You don't have to worry.

Davos : You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges.

Gendry Baratheon : Understood.

Davos : and GENDRY enter the mouth of the cave. JON is walking along the corridor.

Davos : Begging your pardon, Your Grace.

Jon Snow : stops and turns around to face DAVOS.

Jon Snow : You survived King's Landing.

Davos : Yet again.

Jon Snow : Your Grace, this is --

Gendry Baratheon : steps forward in front of DAVOS.

Gendry Baratheon : It's Gendry, Your Grace. I'm Robert Baratheon's son. Bastard son.

Jon Snow : looks to DAVOS.

Davos : He was meant to keep that to himself.

Gendry Baratheon : Our fathers trusted each other. Why shouldn't we?

Jon Snow : I saw your father once at Winterfell.

Gendry Baratheon : I met yours in my shop.

Jon Snow : You're a lot leaner.

Gendry Baratheon : You're a lot shorter.

Jon Snow : stops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles.

Jon Snow : I grew up on stories about them.

Gendry Baratheon : All I ever knew was they fought together and won. Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why. Let me come with you.

Davos : Don't be a fool. You're not a soldier.

Gendry Baratheon : No, but I'm a fighter. And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that.

Jon Snow : Do you know how to use one?

Gendry Baratheon : shakes his head.

Jon Snow : Well, that's a problem.

Gendry Baratheon : I prefer a hammer.

Gendry Baratheon : looks to DAVOS.

Davos : He can handle himself.

Jon Snow : nods.

Jon Snow : We could use the help.

Davos : As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life.

Gendry Baratheon : I owe you my life. Twice over. But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war.

Davos : Yeah. Nobody mind me. All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.

Tyrion Lannister : You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont. Nobody glowers quite like you. Not even Grey Worm.

Tyrion Lannister : retrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands.

Tyrion Lannister : This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us. Remember?

Jorah Mormont : It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.

Tyrion Lannister : smiles and hands the coin to JORAH.

Tyrion Lannister : Take it with you. You'll bring it back. Our queen needs you.

Jorah Mormont : nods to TYRION. DAENERYS appears and walks up to JORAH.

Daenerys Targaryen : We should be better at saying farewell by now.

Jorah Mormont : Your Grace, I --

Daenerys Targaryen : reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands. JON SNOW, DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats. JORAH bends and kisses DAENERY's hand. He turns and continues readying the boat. JON stands in front of DAENERYS.

Jon Snow : If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.

Daenerys Targaryen : smiles.

Daenerys Targaryen : But I've grown used to him.

Jon Snow : I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : nods to JON. JON turns and walks to the head of the boat. The men take hold of it.

Jon Snow : Heave!

Sam : is seated at a table surround by papers and candles. He is writing notes into a book. Gilly is seated across from him reading aloud from a tome. SAM JR. is playing on the bed.

Gilly : Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?

Sam : No.

Gilly : 15782

Sam : looks up from his work annoyed. He remains silent and continues working.

Gilly : Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.

Sam Tarly : looks away and pauses.

Sam Tarly : None anymore.

Gilly : That's true. This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything. He even recorded his own bowel movements. What does "annulment" mean?

Sam Tarly : It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.

Gilly : Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne. Is that a common thing --

Sam Tarly : isn't paying much attention to GILLY. He loudly interrupts her.

Sam Tarly : These maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored. But that's all right, isn't it. We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynardo s 15,782 shits.

Gilly : Steps. That number was steps.

Sam Tarly : is dismayed. He sets his quill down and grabs the book he was writing in and hands it to SAM Jr. He retrieves his cloak and walks out the door.

Sam : is walking through a dark library. He heads to the restricted section and unlocks the barred gate. He begins removing books and scrolls from shelfs and stuff them in his satchel. After retrieving what he needs, SAM quickly walks to the exit of the library. He pauses before he leaves and turns around. He glances back at the library. It is many stories tall lined with countless shelves of books. SAMWELL looks at the library one last time, turns and walks out of the door.

Sam Tarly : is loading a wagon with his things. He walks around to the driver seat. GILLY and SAM JR. are already in the wagon dressed for the road. SAM climbs aboard and takes the reins in his hand.

Gilly : Are you sure you want to do this? You always wanted to be a maester.

Sam Tarly : I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.

Arya Stark : is in the kennels observing PETER BAELISH and a Winterfell servant having a conversation. The servent is whispering in BAELISH's ear. ARYA can't hear the conversation. ARYA sees BAELISH hand the servant a raven scroll. The servant turns to leave. BAELISH senses someone is watching him and he looks to where ARYA stood but she has already vanished. BAELISH turns and leaves the kennels.

Arya Stark : is on the upper level looking down at BAELISH. He is having a conversation with ROBETT GLOVER and YOHN ROYCE. She can't hear what's being said. BAELISH finishes his conversation and walks away from the men. ARYA disappears behind the corner and continues following BAELISH.

Arya Stark : is walking down the hallway. She pauses, peers around a corner and looks towards the door of BAELISH's quarters. BAELISH appears and unlocks his door. Before he walks in MAESTER WOLKAN approaches him. She continues watching the men.

Wolkan : I found it, my Lord.

Wolkan : hands BAELISH a raven scroll.

Wolkan : It took some searching. Maester Llewyn's archives are thorough.

Petyr Baelish : reads the note then looks at WOLKAN.

Petyr Baelish : Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?

Wolkan : Yes, my Lord.

Petyr Baelish : Lady Stark thanks you for your service.

Wolkan : turns and walks away. BAELISH enters his room and shuts the door. ARYA continues watching. A moment later BAELISH opens the door and exits the room, locking the door as he leaves. After he is gone ARYA walks to the door and produces a lockpick from her sleeve. She enters the room and begins searching for the raven scroll. She opens a cabinet but finds nothing of value. She checks another cabinet, then looks in the fireplace and above the mantle finding nothing. She lifts up the mattress and finds a small hole cut into the bedding. She reaches in and retrives the raven scroll. She unrolls it and reads the contents.

Jon Snow : and the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch. JON looks up at the castle. The men collect their equipment and make for the castle.

Tormund : JON, DAVOS, GENDRY, and JORAH sit at a table having a conversation.

Tormund : Isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?

Davos : I've been failing at that job of late.

Tormund : How many queens are there now?

Jon Snow : Two.

Tormund : And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?

Jon Snow : Both.

Tormund : How many men did you bring?

Jon Snow : looks around the table.

Jon Snow : Not enough.

Tormund : The big woman?

Jon Snow : smiles and shakes his head. TORMUND is disappointed.

Jorah Mormont : We were hoping some of your men could help.

Davos : I'll be staying behind. I'm a liability out there as you well know.

Tormund : nods his head.

Tormund : You are.

Tormund : turns to look at JON.

Tormund : You really want to go out there again?

Tormund : You're not the only ones.

Tormund : My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall. Said they were on their way here.

Jon Snow : You're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell.

Sandor : pulls a blanket tight around himself and sits up from the table he was laying on.

Tormund : They want to go beyond the Wall too.

Beric : We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to. Our lord told us the great war is coming.

Gendry Baratheon : Don't trust them. Don't trust any of them.

Gendry Baratheon : They're the Brotherhood. And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.

Jorah Mormont : Thoros?

Thoros : sits up from a dark corner.

Jorah Mormont : I hardly recognized you.

Thoros : Ser Jorah Mormont --

Tormund : turns and angrily looks at JORAH.

Thoros : They won't give me anything to drink down here. I haven't been feeling like myself.

Tormund : You're a fucking Mormont? Like the last Lord Commander?

Jorah Mormont : He was my father.

Tormund : He hunted us like animals.

Jorah Mormont : You returned the favor, as I recall.

Beric : Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.

Davos : Our reasons aren't your reasons.

Beric : It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.

Beric : stands up and walks towards the bars of the cell.

Beric : There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not. We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --

Sandor : For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole. Are we coming with you or not?

Jorah Mormont : Don't you want to know what we're doing?

Thoros : Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?

Jon Snow : He's right. We're all on the same side.

Gendry Baratheon : How can we be?

Jon Snow : We're all breathing.

Tormund : hands the cell keys to JON. JON opens the door and let the men out.

End : CREDITS

Jon Snow : Are you all right?

Gendry Baratheon : faces JON and grunts.

Jon Snow : Ever been north before?

Gendry Baratheon : Never seen snow before.

Tormund : Beautiful, eh? I can breath again. Down south the air smells like pig shit.

Jon Snow : You've never been down south.

Tormund : I've been to Winterfell.

Jon Snow : That's the north.

Gendry Baratheon : How do you live up here? How do you keep your balls from freezing off?

Tormund : You have to keep moving. That's the secret. Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best.

Jon Snow : There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.

Tormund : turns to look at JON and GENDRY.

Tormund : We have to make due with what we've got.

Jon Snow : glances at GENDRY. GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.

Tormund : This one is maybe not so smart.

Jon Snow : Davos says he is a strong fighter.

Tormund : Good. That's more important than being smart.

Tormund : looks at JON as they continue to walk.

Tormund : Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead. So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh? And?

Jon Snow : She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.

Tormund : You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling. Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man. The king beyond the wall never bent the knee. How many of his people died for his pride?

Thoros : Are you still mad at us, boy?

Gendry Baratheon : You sold me to a witch.

Thoros : Priestess. I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction.

Beric : We're fighting a great war. Wars cost money.

Gendry Baratheon : I wanted to be one of you. I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave. Do you know what she did to me? She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --

Sandor : Sounds all right so far.

Gendry Baratheon : and put leeches on me.

Sandor : Was she naked too?

Thoros : She needed your blood.

Gendry Baratheon : Yes. Thank you. I know that.

Sandor : steps in front of GENDRY to halt him.

Sandor : It could have been worse.

Gendry Baratheon : She wanted to kill me. They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --

Sandor : But they didn't, did they? So what you whinging about?

Gendry Baratheon : I'm not whinging.

Sandor : Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something. That's whinging.

Sandor : motions to BERIC.

Sandor : This one's been killed six times. You don't hear him bitching about it.

Sandor : walks away to join the group. BERIC and THOROS smile to each other. THOROS holds his wine flask out to GENDRY who takes a large gulp and hands it back to THOROS.

Thoros : Good lad.

Jon Snow : The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.

Jorah Mormont : He was a good man. He deserved a better son. Were you with him at the end?

Jon Snow : I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.

Jorah Mormont : I can't think of a worse way for him to go. The Night's Watch was his life. He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him.

Jon Snow : I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.

Jorah Mormont : Your father wanted to execute me.

Jon Snow : I heard.

Jorah Mormont : He was in the right of course. It didn't make me hate him any less.

Jorah Mormont : and JON glance at each other.

Jon Snow : I'm glad he didn't capture you.

Jorah Mormont : Me too.

Jon Snow : stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.

Jon Snow : Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw.

Jon Snow : hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.

Jon Snow : Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.

Jorah Mormont : stops examining the sword and looks up to JON.

Jon Snow : But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it.

Jorah Mormont : pauses, then nods at JON.

Jorah Mormont : He gave it to you.

Jon Snow : I'm not his son.

Jorah Mormont : pulls the sword halfway out of the sheath and inspects the blade, turning it in his hands.

Jorah Mormont : I brought shame to my house. I broke my father's heart.

Jorah Mormont : resheaths the blade and hands it back to JON.

Jorah Mormont : I forfeited the right to claim this sword. It's yours. May it serve you well and your children after you.

Arya Stark : Father used to watch us from up here. He wouldn't say much. You probably don't remember. You were inside knitting all the time.

Sansa Stark : I remember.

Arya Stark : One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick. I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground. Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw. There was one arrow in the target. There was no one around, just like now. No one to stop me. So I started shooting. And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. I wasn't very good. Finally I hit the bullseye. It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th. I don't remember. But I hit the bullseye and I heard this.

Arya Stark : starts a slow clap.

Arya Stark : I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me. I knew what I was doing was against the rules. But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong. The rules were wrong. I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it. Now he's dead. Killed by the Lannisters with your help.

Sansa Stark : turns to look at ARYA.

Sansa Stark : What?

Arya Stark : retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it.

Arya Stark : That's your pretty handwriting. Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you. "Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart. Our good King Robert is dead. Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --

Sansa Stark : You don't have to read it. I remember.

Arya Stark : Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort. I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithful sister, Sansa.

Sansa Stark : They forced me to do it.

Arya Stark : Did they. With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?

Sansa Stark : You don't know what it was like. I was a child.

Arya Stark : So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.

Sansa Stark : They told me it was the only way to save father.

Arya Stark : And you were stupid enough to believe them. I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block. I remember the pretty dress you were wearing. I remember the fancy way you did your hair.

Sansa Stark : You were there?

Arya Stark : I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.

Sansa Stark : And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue? Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?

Arya Stark : I wanted to.

Sansa Stark : But you didn't. Just like me.

Arya Stark : I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb. I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.

Sansa Stark : You should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back. Jon didn't win it back. He lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?

Arya Stark : I was training.

Sansa Stark : Training. Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine.

Arya Stark : Oh, I don't know about that. I can imagine quite a lot.

Sansa Stark : You never would have survived what I survived.

Arya Stark : I guess we'll never know.

Sansa Stark : What are you doing to do with that letter.

Arya Stark : I don't know yet.

Sansa Stark : Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?

Arya Stark : You're scared, aren't you? What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes. No one's going to hang you.

Sansa Stark : Arya --

Arya Stark : Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry? No. That's not Jon. He'll understand. You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.

Sansa Stark : Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants. This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --

Arya Stark : The northern lords will read it. They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding. What would little Lyanna Mormont say? She's younger than you were when you wrote this. Are you going to say, "But I was just a child"?

Sansa Stark : You're angry. Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.

Arya Stark : Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things. I'll go with anger.

Arya Stark : turns and walks away.

Tormund : You're the one they call the dog.

Sandor : Fuck off.

Tormund : They told me you were mean. Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?

Sandor : I don't give two shits about Wildlings.

Sandor : looks up at TORMUND.

Sandor : Gingers I hate.

Tormund : Gingers are beautiful. We are kissed by fire. Just like you.

Tormund : points and motions to SANDOR's burned face. SANDOR slaps his hand away.

Sandor : Don't point your fucking finger at me.

Sandor : walks away to rejoin the group. TORMUND begins smiling and walks after him.

Tormund : Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?

Sandor : I didn't trip. I was pushed.

Tormund : Ever since you've been mean.

Sandor : Will you fuck off?

Tormund : I don't think you're truly mean. You have sad eyes.

Sandor : stops and turns to TORMUND.

Sandor : Do you want to suck my dick? Is that it?

Tormund : Dick?

Sandor : Cock.

Tormund : Ah. Dick. I like it.

Sandor : I bet you do.

Sandor : turns and begins walking, TORMUND follows.

Tormund : Nope. It's pussy for me. I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell. If I ever get back there. Yellow hair. Blue eyes. Tallest woman you've ever seen. Almost as tall as you.

Sandor : stops and glances at TORMUND.

Sandor : Brienne of Tarth.

Tormund : You know her?

Sandor : You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?

Tormund : Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me.

Sandor : How does she look at you? Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?

Tormund : nods.

Tormund : You do know her.

Sandor : We've met.

Sandor : and TORMUND begin walking.

Tormund : I want to make babies with her. Think of the great big monsters. They'd conquer the world.

Sandor : How did a mad fucker like you live this long?

Tormund : I'm good at killing people.

Beric : You don't much look like him.

Jon Snow : Who's that?

Beric : Your father. I suppose you favor your mother.

Jon Snow : You knew him?

Beric : Of course I did. When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain. Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back. Thoros has brought me back six times. We both serve the same lord.

Jon Snow : I serve the north.

Beric : The north didn't raise you from the dead.

Jon Snow : The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.

Beric : He wants you alive.

Jon Snow : Why?

Beric : I don't know.

Jon Snow : That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants.

Beric : I think about that all the time. I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing. We're soldiers. We have to know what we're fighting for. I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.

Jon Snow : So what are you fighting for?

Beric : Life. Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last.

Jon Snow : But we all die.

Beric : The enemy always wins. And we still need to fight him. That's all I know. You and I wont find much joy while we're here. But we can keep others alive. We can defend those who can't defend themselves.

Jon Snow : I am the shield that guards the realms of men.

Beric : Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that. Maybe that's enough.

Jon Snow : Aye. Maybe that's enough.

Sandor : stops and looks into the distance. There is a steep mountain ascending into the clouds in the distance.

Sandor : That's what I saw in the fire.

Sandor : points towards the mountain.

Sandor : A mountain like an arrowhead.

Thoros : Are you sure?

Sandor : turns to THOROS and nods his head.

Sandor : We're getting close.

Tyrion Lannister : is sitting in a chair staring into the fire. DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.

Daenerys Targaryen : Do you know what I like about you?

Tyrion Lannister : turns to look at DAENERYS.

Tyrion Lannister : I honestly don't.

Daenerys Targaryen : You're not a hero.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh. I've been heroic on occasion.

Daenerys Targaryen : walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION.

Tyrion Lannister : I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.

Daenerys Targaryen : I don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing.

Tyrion Lannister : It's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you.

Daenerys Targaryen : Jon Snow's not in love with me.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.

Bronn : Oil?

Soldier : Pitch, my lord.

Bronn : How many barrels?

Soldier : 500, my lord.

Bronn : Get 500 more.

Soldier : Yes, my lord.

Bronn : I still enjoy it when they call me "my lord."

Jaime Lannister : The thrill will fade.

Bronn : If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?

Jaime Lannister : Gold?

Bronn : I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?

Jaime Lannister : Family.

Bronn : Not without a cock, you don't.

Jaime Lannister : Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.

Bronn : Yet, your brother--

Jaime Lannister : Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden.

Bronn : I think we're about to be the downtrodden.

Man : Archers, stand tall!

Man : Cover that wall!

Jon Snow : How many people live here?

Tyrion Lannister : A million, give or take.

Jon Snow : That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?

Tyrion Lannister : There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.

Cersei Lannister : Why isn't she with them?

Qyburn : I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her.

Cersei Lannister : And the rest of them?

Qyburn : They're on their way to the dragon pit now.

Cersei Lannister : Including our brother.

Qyburn : Yes, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king.

Missandei : Why did they build it?

Jorah Mormont : Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem.

Tyrion Lannister : I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world.

Davos : Maybe it still is.

Bronn : Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did.

Bronn : I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.

Tyrion Lannister : A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.

Podrick : I never thought I'd see you again, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Supporting the enemy, no less.

Podrick : Hard to blame you.

Tyrion Lannister : Cersei will anyway.

Podrick : I'm glad you're alive.

Bronn : Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.

Soldier : What's in there?

Sandor : Fuck off.

Brienne : I thought you were dead.

Sandor : Not yet. You came pretty close.

Brienne : I was only trying to protect her.

Sandor : You and me both.

Brienne : She's alive. Arya.

Sandor : Where?

Brienne : Winterfell.

Sandor : Who's protecting her if you're here?

Brienne : The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.

Sandor : It won't be me.

Tyrion Lannister : Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.

Podrick : It is, my lord.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

Bronn : I'm sure your new queen--

Tyrion Lannister : You've been thinking about our new queen.

Varys : And that would be double what now, exactly?

Bronn : Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.

Tyrion Lannister : Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk.

Bronn : I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is.

Tyrion Lannister : It's good to see you again.

Bronn : Yeah, you, too.

Sandor : Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first.

Bronn : Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?

Sandor : I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?

Tyrion Lannister : You might.

Sandor : And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.

Tyrion Lannister : And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.

Sandor : Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother.

Cersei Lannister : Where is she?

Tyrion Lannister : She'll be here soon.

Cersei Lannister : Didn't travel with you?

Tyrion Lannister : No.

Cersei Lannister : We've been here for some time.

Daenerys Targaryen : My apologies.

Tyrion Lannister : We are all facing a unique

Euron Greyjoy : Theon! I have your sister

Tyrion Lannister : I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.

Euron Greyjoy : Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.

Euron Greyjoy : We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents.

Jaime Lannister : Perhaps you ought to sit down.

Euron Greyjoy : Why?

Cersei Lannister : Sit down or leave.

Tyrion Lannister : We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face.

Cersei Lannister : So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?

Tyrion Lannister : We all know that will never happen.

Cersei Lannister : Then why are we here?

Jon Snow : This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.

Cersei Lannister : I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.

Jon Snow : This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.

Cersei Lannister : I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce.

Daenerys Targaryen : Yes. That's all.

Cersei Lannister : That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.

Daenerys Targaryen : Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.

Cersei Lannister : The word of a would-be usurper.

Tyrion Lannister : There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.

Jon Snow : We can destroy them by burning them.

Jon Snow : And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world.

Jon Snow : There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.

Daenerys Targaryen : I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.

Jaime Lannister : How many?

Daenerys Targaryen : A hundred thousand, at least.

Euron Greyjoy : Can they swim?

Jon Snow : No.

Euron Greyjoy : Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.

Cersei Lannister : What are you talking about?

Euron Greyjoy : I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me.

Euron Greyjoy : I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive.

Cersei Lannister : He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy.

Cersei Lannister : In return, the King

Daenerys Targaryen : Just the King

Cersei Lannister : I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son.

Jon Snow : I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.

Cersei Lannister : Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.

Brienne : Ser Jaime.

Jaime Lannister : It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.

Brienne : We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.

Jaime Lannister : Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother.

Brienne : Oh, fuck loyalty!

Jaime Lannister : Fuck loyalty?

Brienne : This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.

Jaime Lannister : And tell her what?

Davos : I wish you hadn't done that.

Daenerys Targaryen : I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing.

Jon Snow : I know!

Tyrion Lannister : I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen

Jon Snow : I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.

Tyrion Lannister : That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.

Davos : Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?

Tyrion Lannister : Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister.

Daenerys Targaryen : I didn't come all this way to have my Hand

Tyrion Lannister : I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.

Jon Snow : I did this. I should go.

Tyrion Lannister : She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.

Tyrion Lannister : You spoke with her?

Jaime Lannister : At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?

Jaime Lannister : I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another.

Cersei Lannister : I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place.

Tyrion Lannister : A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you.

Cersei Lannister : So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her.

Tyrion Lannister : I didn't know about that.

Cersei Lannister : And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life.

Tyrion Lannister : Cersei, I didn't know.

Cersei Lannister : the destruction of this family.

Tyrion Lannister : I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.

Cersei Lannister : You killed our father

Tyrion Lannister : After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me.

Cersei Lannister : Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one wouldo ve touched them if Father--

Tyrion Lannister : I have never been more sorry about anything.

Cersei Lannister : I will not hear it, not from you.

Cersei Lannister : I will not hear it!

Tyrion Lannister : All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me.

Tyrion Lannister : If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father.

Tyrion Lannister : I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.

Cersei Lannister : I will not

Tyrion Lannister : I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.

Cersei Lannister : It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.

Tyrion Lannister : If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?

Cersei Lannister : Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something.

Cersei Lannister : What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.

Tyrion Lannister : Mm, not like this.

Cersei Lannister : But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes.

Cersei Lannister : Why?

Tyrion Lannister : Because I think she will make the world a better place.

Cersei Lannister : You said she'd destroy King's Landing.

Tyrion Lannister : She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.

Cersei Lannister : That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.

Cersei Lannister : That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter.

Tyrion Lannister : You're pregnant.

Jon Snow : No one is less happy about this than I am.

Daenerys Targaryen : I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it.

Daenerys Targaryen : This place was the beginning of the end for my family. A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else.

Jon Snow : You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.

Daenerys Targaryen : I can't have children.

Jon Snow : Who told you that?

Daenerys Targaryen : The witch who murdered my husband.

Jon Snow : Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?

Daenerys Targaryen : You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different.

Jon Snow : So, what now?

Daenerys Targaryen : I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.

Jon Snow : It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.

Cersei Lannister : My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them.

Petyr Baelish : It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.

Sansa Stark : No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?

Petyr Baelish : I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.

Sansa Stark : This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee.

Petyr Baelish : I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.

Sansa Stark : What does that have to do with anything?

Petyr Baelish : Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.

Sansa Stark : You think he wants to marry her?

Petyr Baelish : An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King.

Sansa Stark : Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family.

Petyr Baelish : You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?

Sansa Stark : Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?

Petyr Baelish : Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men.

Sansa Stark : They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?

Petyr Baelish : She's your sister

Sansa Stark : She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.

Petyr Baelish : Why did she come to Winterfell?

Sansa Stark : To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.

Petyr Baelish : Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?

Sansa Stark : To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.

Petyr Baelish : And after she murders you, what does she become?

Sansa Stark : Lady

Jon Snow : If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight.

Daenerys Targaryen : And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell.

Jorah Mormont : Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror.

Jon Snow : It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message.

Daenerys Targaryen : I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.

Theon Greyjoy : Jon.

Theon Greyjoy : Can I speak with you?

Jon Snow : All right.

Theon Greyjoy : What you did in King's Landing, what you said... You couldo ve lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth.

Jon Snow : We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.

Theon Greyjoy : You've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step.

Jon Snow : It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret.

Theon Greyjoy : Not compared to me, you haven't.

Jon Snow : No. Not compared to you.

Theon Greyjoy : I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.

Jon Snow : Our father was more of a father.

Theon Greyjoy : He was.

Jon Snow : And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.

Theon Greyjoy : I did.

Jon Snow : But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.

Theon Greyjoy : But the things I've done.

Jon Snow : It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark.

Theon Greyjoy : When I was Ramsay's prisoner, Yara tried to save me. She's the only one who tried to save me. She needs me now.

Jon Snow : So, why are you still talking to me?

Harrag : Load up. Load up, lads. Go on. Tide's coming in.

Theon Greyjoy : All of us chose to follow Yara. We left the Iron Islands for Yara. She would never leave one of us behind. We're not leaving her behind.

Harrag : Your sister--

Theon Greyjoy : She's not dead.

Harrag : She's dead. Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead.

Theon Greyjoy : She's our queen

Harrag : She's your sister

Theon Greyjoy : I did. I ran from my uncle.

Harrag : So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you? They say the dead can't swim. We're going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves.

Theon Greyjoy : We're done with all that.

Harrag : Who says we are?

Theon Greyjoy : Yara did. She made a pledge. We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free.

Harrag : Run away, little Theon. It's what you do best.

Man : He needs to shut his mouth.

Man : Hey!

Man : Oh, yes!

Man : That's more like it.

Harrag : Stay down or I'll kill you!

Harrag : I said stay down or I'll kill you!

Theon Greyjoy : Not for me. For Yara!

Men : Yara!

Sansa Stark : Have my sister

Arya Stark : Are you sure you want to do this?

Sansa Stark : It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.

Arya Stark : And what does honor demand?

Sansa Stark : That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.

Arya Stark : All right, then. Get on with it.

Sansa Stark : You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?

Arya Stark : My sister asked you a question.

Petyr Baelish : Lady Sansa, forgive me I'm a bit confused.

Sansa Stark : Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?

Petyr Baelish : I did it to protect you.

Sansa Stark : You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon.

Petyr Baelish : Whatever your aunt

Sansa Stark : You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon.

Petyr Baelish : I know of no such letter.

Sansa Stark : You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father.

Petyr Baelish : I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth.

Bran Stark : You held a knife to his throat.

Bran Stark : You said, "I did warn you not the trust me."

Arya Stark : You told our mother

Petyr Baelish : Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. I've protected you.

Sansa Stark : Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?

Petyr Baelish : If we could speak alone, I can explain everything.

Sansa Stark : Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother.

Petyr Baelish : Sansa, please.

Sansa Stark : I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn.

Petyr Baelish : Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that.

Petyr Baelish : I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.

John Royce : I think not.

Petyr Baelish : Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy.

Sansa Stark : And yet, you betrayed her.

Petyr Baelish : I loved you. More than anyone.

Sansa Stark : And yet, you betrayed me.

Sansa Stark : When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them.

Petyr Baelish : Sansa! I--

Jaime Lannister : Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.

Man : It'll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train.

Jaime Lannister : We don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell.

Cersei Lannister : Ser Jaime.

Jaime Lannister : Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : My lords, I need a moment with my brother.

Men : Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : What are you doing?

Jaime Lannister : Preparing the expedition north.

Cersei Lannister : Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?

Jaime Lannister : You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.

Cersei Lannister : I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father.

Jaime Lannister : You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.

Cersei Lannister : I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?

Jaime Lannister : This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!

Cersei Lannister : And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen--

Jaime Lannister : I made a promise.

Cersei Lannister : Our child will rule Westeros.

Jaime Lannister : Our child will never be born if the dead come south.

Cersei Lannister : The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us.

Jaime Lannister : And then what?

Cersei Lannister : And then we rule.

Jaime Lannister : When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!

Cersei Lannister : The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.

Jaime Lannister : I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.

Cersei Lannister : How many dragons did you see at the pit?

Jaime Lannister : Two.

Cersei Lannister : What happened to the third?

Jaime Lannister : For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!

Cersei Lannister : She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable.

Jaime Lannister : We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!

Cersei Lannister : No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You shouldo ve listened more when Father--

Jaime Lannister : The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?

Cersei Lannister : Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?

Jaime Lannister : You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander.

Cersei Lannister : And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen.

Jaime Lannister : I didn't conspire with him.

Cersei Lannister : You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.

Jaime Lannister : I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.

Cersei Lannister : And that will be treason.

Jaime Lannister : Treason?

Cersei Lannister : Disobeying your queen

Jaime Lannister : Doesn't matter what I'd call it.

Cersei Lannister : I told you no one walks away from me.

Jaime Lannister : Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father

Cersei Lannister : There's one more yet to come.

Jaime Lannister : Give the order, then.

Jaime Lannister : I don't believe you.

Bran Stark : Come in.

Bran Stark : Samwell Tarly.

Sam : I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.

Bran Stark : I remember everything.

Bran Stark : You helped us get beyond the Wall. You're a good man.

Sam : Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?

Bran Stark : I became the Three-Eyed Raven.

Sam : Oh! I don't know what that means.

Bran Stark : I can see things that happened in the past. I can see things happening now all over the world. Why did you come to Winterfell?

Sam : Um, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him.

Bran Stark : He's on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen. You you saw this in a vision?

Sam : Oh.

Bran Stark : He needs to know the truth.

Sam : The truth about what?

Bran Stark : About himself. No one knows. No one but me. Jon isn't really my father's son He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt.

Sam : It's not.

Bran Stark : Dornish bastards are named Sand.

Sam : At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony.

Bran Stark : Are you certain?

Sam : It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?

Rhaegar : Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days.

Lyanna : Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days.

Bran Stark : Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie. Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt.

Bran Stark : He loved her. And she loved him.

Bran Stark : And Jon - Jon's real name.

Lyanna : His name is Aegon.

Bran Stark : He's never been a bastard.

Brans Voice : He needs to know. We need to tell him.

Arya Stark : Are you all right?

Sansa Stark : It's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me.

Arya Stark : You did the right thing.

Sansa Stark : You did it.

Arya Stark : I'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady.

Sansa Stark : Does that bother you?

Arya Stark : I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.

Sansa Stark : You would have. You're the strongest person I know.

Arya Stark : I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.

Sansa Stark : Well, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying.

Arya Stark : In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another.

Sansa Stark : Father

Arya Stark : I miss him.

Sansa Stark : Me, too.

Beric : It's a long way down.

Tormund : Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.

Man : I can see movement. Watch, on the tree line!

Man : What is it?

Tormund : Come on! Run! Run!

Tyrion Lannister : You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won't freeze off.

Varys : You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?

Tyrion Lannister : Because I have balls, and you don't.

Jon Snow : I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.

Jon Snow : Look at you.

Jon Snow : You're a man.

Bran Stark : Almost.

Jon Snow : Where's Arya?

Sansa Stark : Lurking somewhere.

Jon Snow : Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell.

Daenerys Targaryen : Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you.

Sansa Stark : Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.

Bran Stark : We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.

Bran Stark : He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south.

Sansa Stark : As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?

Umber : We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady.

Umber : And my lord.

Umber : And my queen. Sorry.

Sansa Stark : You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.

Jon Snow : We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.

Maester Wolkan : At once, Your Grace.

Lyanna Mormont : Your Grace.

Lyanna : But you're not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- I'm not sure what you are now.

Lyanna : A lord? Nothing at all?

Jon Snow : It's not important.

Lyanna : Not important? We named you King in the North.

Man : King of the North!

Jon Snow : You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North.

Tyrion Lannister : If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause.

Tyrion Lannister : I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die.

Sansa Stark : May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?

Daenerys Targaryen : Whatever they want.

Gendry Baratheon : Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it.

Man : Sorry 'bout that.

Gendry Baratheon : Are these the last of the wagons?

Man : Aye.

Gendry Baratheon : All right, let's get it all to the forges.

Tyrion Lannister : My lord. My lady.

Royce : My lady.

Tyrion Lannister : The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.

Sansa Stark : So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose.

Tyrion Lannister : Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.

Sansa Stark : It had its moments.

Sansa Stark : Apologies for leaving like that.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.

Sansa Stark : We both survived.

Tyrion Lannister : Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-

Sansa Stark : Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?

Tyrion Lannister : She did.

Sansa Stark : And you believed her?

Tyrion Lannister : She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.

Sansa Stark : I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.

Arya Stark : You used to be taller.

Jon Snow : How did you sneak up on me?

Arya Stark : How did you survive a knife through the heart?

Jon Snow : I didn't.

Jon Snow : You still have it.

Arya Stark : Needle.

Jon Snow : Have you ever used it?

Arya Stark : Once or twice.

Arya Stark : Valyrian steel.

Jon Snow : Jealous?

Arya Stark : Too heavy for me.

Jon Snow : Where were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa.

Arya Stark : She doesn't like your queen, does she?

Jon Snow : Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.

Arya Stark : She's the smartest person I've ever met.

Jon Snow : Now you're defending her?

Jon Snow : You?

Arya Stark : I'm defending our family. So is she.

Jon Snow : Yeah. I'm her family too.

Arya Stark : Don't forget that.

Qyburn : Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall.

Cersei Lannister : Good.

Yara Greyjoy : Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?

Euron Greyjoy : But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.

Euron Greyjoy : If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?

Euron Greyjoy : I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.

Yara Greyjoy : Are we in King's Landing?

Euron Greyjoy : Mm.

Yara Greyjoy : You picked the losing side.

Euron Greyjoy : Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.

Euron Greyjoy : But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.

Cersei Lannister : Twenty-thousand men, is it?

Harry : Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit.

Euron Greyjoy : They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.

Cersei Lannister : Horses?

Harry : Two thousand.

Cersei Lannister : And elephants?

Harry : Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.

Harry : They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages.

Cersei Lannister : In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland.

Harry : We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace.

Euron Greyjoy : Am I most welcome here?

Cersei Lannister : You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.

Euron Greyjoy : Good. As a true friend and an honored guest

Euron Greyjoy : I was hoping we could talk in private.

Cersei Lannister : After the war. That was our agreement.

Euron Greyjoy : Wars sometimes last years.

Cersei Lannister : You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her.

Euron Greyjoy : How?

Euron Greyjoy : I've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken.

Cersei Lannister : You're insolent. I've executed men for less.

Euron Greyjoy : They were lesser men.

Dirah : I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.

Crayah : Burnt up some of my favorite boys.

Dirah : Archie, was it?

Crayah : And William.

Dirah : Tall handsome William?

Crayah : Yeah, tall handsome William.

Dirah : They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.

Bronn : I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.

Crayah : Did you?

Bronn : Nearly killed it.

Marei : That's brave.

Crayah : That boy Eddie.

Dirah : The ginger?

Crayah : That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.

Dirah : How does he sleep with no eyelids?

Bronn : All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?

Qyburn : Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

Bronn : You're kidding me.

Qyburn : Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry.

Bronn : Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps.

Crayah : You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.

Qyburn : Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.

Bronn : Which girl?

Qyburn : The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.

Bronn : She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them.

Qyburn : That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.

Bronn : So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-

Qyburn : She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.

Bronn : Yeah, well, good luck with that.

Qyburn : Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-

Qyburn : She has a keen sense of poetic justice.

Bronn : That fucking family.

Qyburn : When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?

Cersei Lannister : I wanted those elephants.

Euron Greyjoy : So, how do I compare to the fat king?

Cersei Lannister : You're insulting my late husband?

Euron Greyjoy : Are you offended?

Cersei Lannister : Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body.

Euron Greyjoy : And the Kingslayer?

Cersei Lannister : You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?

Euron Greyjoy : Life is boring.

Cersei Lannister : You're not boring, I'll give you that.

Euron Greyjoy : Do I please the queen?

Cersei Lannister : You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.

Cersei Lannister : But now I want to be alone.

Euron Greyjoy : I'm going to put a prince in your belly.

Yara Greyjoy : Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships.

Yara Greyjoy : We can take our home back.

Theon Greyjoy : Daenerys went north.

Yara Greyjoy : Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.

Theon Greyjoy : You're my queen. I go where you command.

Yara Greyjoy : You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.

Theon Greyjoy : What is dead may never die.

Yara Greyjoy : But kill the bastards anyway.

Wolkan : Welcome back, my lady. If you'd follow me

Varys : The Karstarks.

Tyrion Lannister : One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway.

Davos : Can't argue with that.

Davos : Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.

Tyrion Lannister : And our queen is grateful.

Davos : Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it.

Tyrion Lannister : I sense that you're leading to a proposal.

Davos : A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?

Tyrion Lannister : They do make a handsome couple.

Varys : You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm not that old.

Tyrion Lannister : Not as old as him.

Tyrion Lannister : Our queen respects the wisdom of age.

Varys : Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.

Tyrion Lannister : What is that?

Varys : Nothing lasts.

Daenerys Targaryen : Your sister doesn't like me.

Jon Snow : She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up.

Daenerys Targaryen : She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-

Daenerys Targaryen : How many today?

Dothraki Man : Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.

Jon Snow : What's the matter?

Daenerys Targaryen : The dragons are barely eating.

Jon Snow : What's wrong with them?

Daenerys Targaryen : They don't like the North.

Daenerys Targaryen : Go on.

Jon Snow : I don't know how to ride a dragon.

Daenerys Targaryen : Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.

Jon Snow : What if he doesn't want me to?

Daenerys Targaryen : Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.

Jon Snow : What do I hold onto?

Daenerys Targaryen : Whatever you can.

Jon Snow : You've completely ruined horses for me.

Daenerys Targaryen : We could stay a thousand years-

Daenerys Targaryen : No one would find us.

Jon Snow : We'd be pretty old.

Jon Snow : It's cold up here for a southern girl.

Daenerys Targaryen : So keep your queen warm.

Daenerys Targaryen : Don't be afraid.

Man : Gendry?

Man : He's here.

Gendry Baratheon : It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.

Sandor : You're saying you're good, is that it?

Gendry Baratheon : I'm just saying it's a tricky material to-

Sandor : You know who makes weapons for the wildlings? Cripples and cocksuckers. Which one are you?

Arya Stark : Leave him be.

Sandor : I heard you were here. You left me to die.

Arya Stark : First I robbed you.

Sandor : You're a cold little bitch, aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive.

Arya Stark : That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.

Gendry Baratheon : Yeah, thanks. So have you.

Gendry Baratheon : I mean, you look good.

Arya Stark : Thanks. So do you.

Gendry Baratheon : It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold.

Arya Stark : Stay close to that forge, then.

Gendry Baratheon : Is that a command, Lady Stark?

Arya Stark : Don't call me that.

Gendry Baratheon : As you wish, milady.

Arya Stark : Here's my wish.

Arya Stark : Can you make it?

Gendry Baratheon : What do you need something like this for?

Arya Stark : Can you make it or not?

Gendry Baratheon : You already have a sword. What's that?

Gendry Baratheon : It's Valyrian steel. I always knew you were just another rich girl.

Arya Stark : You don't know any other rich girls.

Sansa Stark : Come in.

Sansa Stark : Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men.

Jon Snow : House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years." Isn't that what he said?

Sansa Stark : I will stand behind Jon Snow," he said.

Sansa Stark : The King in the North.

Jon Snow : I told you we needed allies.

Sansa Stark : You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.

Jon Snow : I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons.

Sansa Stark : And a Targaryen queen.

Jon Snow : Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance.

Jon Snow : Do you have any faith in me at all?

Sansa Stark : You know I do.

Jon Snow : She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.

Sansa Stark : No, she's much prettier.

Sansa Stark : Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?

Sam Tarly : Oh!

Daenerys Targaryen : So you're the man?

Sam Tarly : Um. Which man am I, Your Grace?

Daenerys Targaryen : The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.

Jorah Mormont : They could, they just wouldn't.

Daenerys Targaryen : I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward.

Sam Tarly : Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : Well, there must be something I could give you.

Sam Tarly : If it's not too much trouble, I could use a pardon.

Daenerys Targaryen : For what crime?

Sam Tarly : Um, I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.

Sam Tarly : And also a sword.

Daenerys Targaryen : From the Citadel?

Sam Tarly : From my family. It's been in House Tarly for generations.

Sam Tarly : It wouldo ve been mine anyway, eventually, but my father had other ideas.

Daenerys Targaryen : Not Randyll Tarly?

Sam Tarly : You know him?

Daenerys Targaryen : I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.

Sam Tarly : Well At least I'll be allowed home again, now that my brother's the lord.

Daenerys Targaryen : Your brother stood with your father.

Sam Tarly : Hm. Thank you, Your Grace. For telling me. And m- may I?

Daenerys Targaryen : Of course.

Sam Tarly : What are you doing out here?

Bran Stark : Waiting, for an old friend. It's time to tell Jon the truth.

Sam Tarly : No, no. You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?

Bran Stark : I'm not his brother. He trusts you more than anyone. Now's the time.

Jon Snow : Sam?

Sam Tarly : I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here.

Jon Snow : Were you hiding from me?

Sam Tarly : Of course not.

Jon Snow : What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?

Jon Snow : What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?

Sam Tarly : She's good.

Jon Snow : Little Sam?

Sam Tarly : Don't you know?

Jon Snow : Know what?

Sam Tarly : Daenerys. She executed my father and brother. They were her prisoners.

Sam Tarly : She didn't tell you.

Jon Snow : I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.

Sam Tarly : Would you have done it?

Jon Snow : Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me.

Sam Tarly : You've also spared men. Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.

Jon Snow : I wasn't a king.

Sam Tarly : But you were. You've always been.

Jon Snow : I gave up my crown, Sam.

Jon Snow : I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.

Sam Tarly : I'm not talking about the King in the North. I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.

Sam Tarly : Bran and I worked it out. I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had whatever Bran has.

Jon Snow : What are you talking about?

Sam Tarly : Your mother was Lyanna Stark.

Sam Tarly : And your father- your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen. You've never been a bastard. You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne. I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in.

Jon Snow : My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.

Sam Tarly : No. Your father- Well, Ned Stark. He promised your mother he'd always protect you. And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew. You're the true king. Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it.

Jon Snow : Daenerys is our queen.

Sam Tarly : She shouldn't be.

Jon Snow : That's treason.

Sam Tarly : It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?

Edd : Stay back, he's got blue eyes!

Tormund : I've always had blue eyes!

Beric : Did you find anyone?

Edd : The Umber boy.

Beric : It's a message. From the Night King.

Tormund : His army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.

Edd : We rode down from Castle Black. We can double up on the horses.

Tormund : If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead.

Tormund : We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first-

Daenerys Targaryen : When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father.

Daenerys Targaryen : Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.

Daenerys Targaryen : He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.

Daenerys Targaryen : Your sister pledged to send her army north.

Jaime Lannister : She did.

Daenerys Targaryen : I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me.

Jaime Lannister : She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.

Jaime Lannister : She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors.

Daenerys Targaryen : We"?

Jaime Lannister : I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace, I know my brother-

Daenerys Targaryen : Like you knew your sister?

Tyrion Lannister : He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?

Daenerys Targaryen : Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat.

Sansa Stark : You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours.

Jaime Lannister : Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again.

Bran Stark : The things we do for love.

Daenerys Targaryen : So why have you abandoned your house and family now?

Jaime Lannister : Because this goes beyond loyalty.

Jaime Lannister : This is about survival.

Brienne : You don't know me well, Your Grace.

Brienne : But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it.

Brienne : Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother.

Sansa Stark : You vouch for him?

Brienne : I do.

Sansa Stark : You would fight beside him?

Brienne : I would.

Sansa Stark : I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay.

Daenerys Targaryen : What does the Warden of the North say about it?

Jon Snow : We need every man we can get.

Daenerys Targaryen : Very well.

Jaime Lannister : Thank you, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool.

Tyrion Lannister : I was a fool.

Daenerys Targaryen : Not for the first time.

Daenerys Targaryen : Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can.

Tyrion Lannister : I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.

Gendry Baratheon : Don't you have something better to do?

Arya Stark : You make my weapon yet?

Gendry Baratheon : Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.

Arya Stark : You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.

Gendry Baratheon : It's strong enough.

Gendry Baratheon : It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know.

Arya Stark : Are you going to be down in the crypt?

Gendry Baratheon : No, but-

Arya Stark : But you're a fighter.

Gendry Baratheon : I've done my share.

Arya Stark : You've fought them?

Gendry Baratheon : I did. Some of them.

Arya Stark : How many?

Gendry Baratheon : A few. That was enough.

Arya Stark : What are they like?

Gendry Baratheon : Bad. Really bad.

Arya Stark : Really bad"?

Arya Stark : Even a smith's apprentice can do better than "really bad." What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?

Gendry Baratheon : Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-this is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like.

Arya Stark : I know Death.

Arya Stark : He's got many faces.

Arya Stark : I look forward to seeing this one.

Arya Stark : My weapon?

Gendry Baratheon : I'll get right on it.

Jaime Lannister : I'm sorry for what I did to you.

Bran Stark : You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.

Jaime Lannister : I'm not that person anymore.

Bran Stark : You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark.

Jaime Lannister : You're not?

Bran Stark : No. I'm something else now.

Jaime Lannister : You're not angry at me.

Bran Stark : I'm not angry at anyone.

Jaime Lannister : Why didn't you tell them?

Bran Stark : You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.

Jaime Lannister : What about afterwards?

Bran Stark : How do you know there is an afterwards?

Tyrion Lannister : Well, here we are.

Jaime Lannister : Yes, here we are.

Tyrion Lannister : Together again.

Tyrion Lannister : And the masses rejoice.

Jaime Lannister : How do they feel about their new queen?

Tyrion Lannister : She's your new queen too.

Tyrion Lannister : They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.

Jaime Lannister : And she is? Different?

Tyrion Lannister : She is.

Jaime Lannister : You're sure about her?

Tyrion Lannister : I am.

Jaime Lannister : She didn't seem sure about you.

Tyrion Lannister : It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.

Jaime Lannister : Hmm.

Tyrion Lannister : Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.

Tyrion Lannister : Was she lying about the baby too?

Jaime Lannister : No, that part is real.

Jaime Lannister : She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.

Jaime Lannister : What?

Tyrion Lannister : She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway.

Tyrion Lannister : So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I wouldo ve chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-

Both : A girl's mouth around-

Jaime Lannister : Your cock.

Tyrion Lannister : My cock.

Tyrion Lannister : At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.

Tyrion Lannister : Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.

Brienne : Ser Jaime.

Jaime Lannister : Lady Brienne.

Jaime Lannister : He's come a long way.

Brienne : He's alright. Still has a lot to learn.

Jaime Lannister : I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.

Brienne : I am. It's, uh-it's good ground.

Jaime Lannister : It is.

Brienne : The rise, it should give us some advantage.

Brienne : If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back.

Jaime Lannister : Yes, I think you're right.

Brienne : What are you doing?

Brienne : I think you know.

Jaime Lannister : I truly don't.

Brienne : We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.

Jaime Lannister : You want me to insult you?

Brienne : No!

Jaime Lannister : Good.

Jaime Lannister : I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me.

Brienne : I better get back.

Jorah Mormont : Forgive me, khaleesi.

Daenerys Targaryen : Have you done something to offend me?

Jorah Mormont : Many things.

Daenerys Targaryen : Long ago and long forgiven.

Jorah Mormont : But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart.

Daenerys Targaryen : When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

Jorah Mormont : You made the right choice.

Daenerys Targaryen : I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.

Jorah Mormont : I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.

Jorah Mormont : But the mind behind all those words-

Daenerys Targaryen : He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.

Jorah Mormont : As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.

Daenerys Targaryen : You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?

Jorah Mormont : I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me.

Royce : The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates.

Sansa Stark : Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.

Daenerys Targaryen : Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone.

Daenerys Targaryen : I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.

Sansa Stark : Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone.

Daenerys Targaryen : I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.

Sansa Stark : Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.

Daenerys Targaryen : I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.

Daenerys Targaryen : I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei.

Sansa Stark : You never should have either.

Daenerys Targaryen : I thought he knew his sister.

Sansa Stark : Families are complicated.

Daenerys Targaryen : Ours certainly have been.

Sansa Stark : A sad thing to have in common.

Daenerys Targaryen : We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell.

Daenerys Targaryen : And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother.

Sansa Stark : He loves you, you know that.

Daenerys Targaryen : That bothers you.

Sansa Stark : Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.

Daenerys Targaryen : All my life, I've known one goal

Sansa Stark : I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.

Daenerys Targaryen : I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about.

Sansa Stark : Who was the first?

Daenerys Targaryen : Someone taller.

Sansa Stark : And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?

Daenerys Targaryen : I take the Iron Throne.

Sansa Stark : What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?

Wolkan : Apologies, my lady. Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : What is it?

Theon Greyjoy : My queen.

Daenerys Targaryen : Your sister?

Theon Greyjoy : She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name.

Daenerys Targaryen : But why aren't you with her?

Theon Greyjoy : I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me.

Man : Milord, we're not soldiers.

Davos : You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way.

Man : Thank you.

Gilly : When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts.

Gilly : They're the safest place to be. Through that archway right over there.

Woman : Thank you.

Teela : Which way should I go?

Davos : Which way do you want to go?

Teela : All the children will be going below when the time comes.

Teela : But both me brothers were soldiers. I want to fight too.

Gilly : That's good to hear. I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot better with you down there to protect us.

Davos : I'm sure a lot of people would.

Teela : All right. I'll defend the crypt, then.

Tormund : My little crow.

Jon Snow : I thought we'd lost you.

Tormund : Almost.

Jon Snow : How did you find each other?

Edd : We met up at the Last Hearth.

Tormund : The dead got there first.

Jon Snow : The Umbers?

Beric : Fighting for the Night King now.

Tormund : We had to travel around them to get here. Whoever's not here now is with them.

Jon Snow : How long do we have?

Tormund : Before the sun comes up tomorrow.

Tormund : The big woman still here?

Jon Snow : They're coming.

Jon Snow : We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.

Jon Snow : But there are too many of them.

Jon Snow : Far too many.

Jon Snow : Our enemy doesn't tire.

Jon Snow : Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.

Jon Snow : We can't beat them in a straight fight.

Jaime Lannister : So, what can we do?

Jon Snow : The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.

Jaime Lannister : If that's true, he'll never expose himself.

Bran Stark : Yes, he will.

Bran Stark : He'll come for me. He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens.

Sam Tarly : Why? What does he want?

Bran Stark : An endless night. He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory.

Sam Tarly : That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you.

Tyrion Lannister : How will he find you?

Bran Stark : His mark is on me.

Bran Stark : He always knows where I am.

Jon Snow : We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest.

Bran Stark : No. We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all. I'll wait for him in the Godswood.

Sansa Stark : You want us to use you as bait?

Arya Stark : We're not leaving you alone out there.

Theon Greyjoy : He won't be. I'll stay with him. With the Ironborn. I took this castle from you. Let me defend you now.

Davos : We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.

Tyrion Lannister : When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench.

Daenerys Targaryen : Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives.

Daenerys Targaryen : There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it.

Davos : The dragons should give us an edge in the field.

Jon Snow : If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does.

Arya Stark : Dragonfire will stop him?

Bran Stark : I don't know. No one's ever tried.

Tormund : We're all going to die.

Tormund : But at least we die together.

Jon Snow : Let's get some rest.

Jon Snow : Your Grace.

Tyrion Lannister : Do you need help?

Bran Stark : No.

Tyrion Lannister : You've had a strange journey.

Bran Stark : Stranger than most.

Tyrion Lannister : I'd like to hear about it.

Bran Stark : It's a long story.

Tyrion Lannister : If only we were trapped in a castle, in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go.

Missandei : Hello.

Grey Worm : When Daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here. I am loyal to my queen. I will fight for her until her enemies are defeated, but when the war is over and she has won, do you want to grow old in this place? Is there nothing else you want to do, nothing else you want to see?

Missandei : Naath. I'd like to see the beaches again.

Grey Worm : Then I will take you there.

Missandei : My people are peaceful. We cannot protect ourselves.

Grey Worm : My people are not peaceful. We will protect you.

Sam Tarly : Have you told her yet?

Jon Snow : No.

Sam Tarly : Mm-hmm. Being careful. Biding your time. Waiting for the perfect-

Edd : And now our watch begins.

Jon Snow : Gilly? Little Sam?

Sam Tarly : They'll be safe down in the crypt.

Jon Snow : If you want to join them.

Jon Snow : To protect them.

Sam Tarly : Everyone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker. I've killed Thenns.

Edd : Thenn.

Sam Tarly : I've saved Gilly more than once. I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men. You need me out there.

Edd : Well, if that's what it's come to, we really are fucked.

Sam Tarly : Well, calling you "fucked" wouldn't be strictly accurate.

Edd : Samwell Tarly. Slayer of White Walkers. Lover of Ladies. As if we needed any more signs the world was ending.

Sam Tarly : Think back to where we started. Us, Grenn, Pyp.

Jon Snow : Now it's just us three.

Edd : Last man left, burn the rest of us.

Tyrion Lannister : I wish Father were here.

Tyrion Lannister : I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.

Jaime Lannister : That would be something to see.

Tyrion Lannister : I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall.

Jaime Lannister : Mm.

Tyrion Lannister : You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.

Jaime Lannister : It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.

Tyrion Lannister : I was speaking in relative terms.

Jaime Lannister : Do you miss it?

Tyrion Lannister : Of course I miss it.

Jaime Lannister : Well, my golden lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not. Things would be easier if it were.

Tyrion Lannister : The perils of self-betterment.

Jaime Lannister : Oh! My lady.

Brienne : Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt. We were just looking for somewhere warm to-

Tyrion Lannister : To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.

Podrick : Thank you, milord.

Brienne : I don't think that's wise.

Brienne : The battle might start at any moment.

Brienne : Half cup.

Tyrion Lannister : And you?

Brienne : No, thank you. I should try and get some sleep.

Jaime Lannister : You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.

Brienne : All right. Just a bit.

Davos : Well, what do we have here?

Tyrion Lannister : Ser Davos, join us.

Davos : No, not for me, thanks. Came here for this.

Davos : I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.

Tormund : It could be our last night in this world, you know.

Brienne : Yes, well, I'm glad you're here.

Brienne : Here fighting with us. Glad you survived Eastwatch.

Tyrion Lannister : Would you like a drink?

Tormund : Brought my own.

Tormund : They call you "King Killer."

Jaime Lannister : I'm sure someone does.

Tormund : They call me "Giantsbane." Want to know why?

Tormund : I killed a giant when I was ten. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.

Tormund : When she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That's how I got so strong. Giant's milk.

Davos : Maybe I will have that drink.

Sandor : You never used to shut up. Now you're just sitting there like a mute.

Arya Stark : Guess I've changed.

Arya Stark : What are you doing up here?

Sandor : What's it look like?

Arya Stark : No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?

Sandor : I fought for you, didn't I?

Sandor : Oh, for fuck's sake. May as well be at a bloody wedding.

Beric : My lady. It's good to see you again. I'm sorry we parted the way we did.

Sandor : Was he on your list?

Arya Stark : For a little while.

Beric : That's all right.

Beric : The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same. This is his moment. When light-

Sandor : Thoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a sermon. Because if you are, the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back nineteen times just to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall.

Sandor : Where are you going?

Arya Stark : I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.

Arya Stark : That for me?

Arya Stark : This'll work.

Gendry Baratheon : Last time you saw me, you wanted me to come to Winterfell. Took the long road, but.

Arya Stark : What did the Red Woman want with you?

Gendry Baratheon : She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.

Arya Stark : Why your blood?

Gendry Baratheon : I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.

Gendry Baratheon : I didn't know until she told me. Then she tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me.

Arya Stark : Was that your first time?

Gendry Baratheon : No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock.

Arya Stark : Your first time with a woman.

Gendry Baratheon : What? I-I didn't-I wasn't with her.

Arya Stark : Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?

Arya Stark : Or after?

Arya Stark : You don't remember?

Gendry Baratheon : Yes, I was.

Arya Stark : One? Two? Twenty?

Gendry Baratheon : Well, I didn't keep count.

Arya Stark : Yes, you did.

Gendry Baratheon : Three.

Arya Stark : We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.

Gendry Baratheon : Arya, I-

Arya Stark : I'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.

Tyrion Lannister : It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together.

Brienne : At least we'll die with honor.

Tyrion Lannister : I think we might live.

Tyrion Lannister : I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.

Davos : All without a shred of combat ability.

Tyrion Lannister : Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke.

Jaime Lannister : Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.

Tyrion Lannister : Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne.

Tormund : She's not a ser? You're not a knight?

Brienne : Women can't be knights.

Tormund : Why not?

Brienne : Tradition.

Tormund : Fuck tradition.

Brienne : I don't even want to be a knight.

Tormund : I'm no king. But if I were, I'd knight you ten times over.

Jaime Lannister : You don't need a king. Any knight can make another knight.

Jaime Lannister : I'll prove it.

Jaime Lannister : Kneel, Lady Brienne.

Jaime Lannister : Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.

Jaime Lannister : In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.

Jaime Lannister : In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just.

Jaime Lannister : In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent.

Jaime Lannister : Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

Tyrion Lannister : Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!

Jorah Mormont : We have all we need to win this war.

Lyanna : I have trained my men, women and children. I have fought before. I can fight again.

Jorah Mormont : Please, listen to me. You're the future of our house.

Lyanna : I don't need you to remind me of that.

Jorah Mormont : You'll be safer in the crypt. These things we're fighting-

Lyanna : I will not hide underground. I pledged to fight for the North, and I will fight.

Sam Tarly : Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-

Lyann : It's all right. We're done here.

Lyanna : I wish you good fortune, cousin.

Jorah Mormont : Thank you, my lady.

Jorah Mormont : What have you got there?

Sam Tarly : It's called Heartsbane. It's my family sword.

Jorah Mormont : You still have a family.

Sam Tarly : Yes. And I'd love to defend them with it. But I can't really hold it upright. Your father, he taught me how to be a man. How to do what's right. This is right. It's Valyrian steel. I'd be honored if you'd take it.

Jorah Mormont : I'll wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.

Sam Tarly : I'll see you when it's through.

Sam Tarly : I hope we win.

Jaime Lannister : We'd better get some rest.

Tyrion Lannister : No, let's stay a bit longer.

Davos : We're out of wine.

Tyrion Lannister : How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?

Davos : You'll pray for a quick death.

Tyrion Lannister : Ser Brienne?

Tormund : Mm-mm.

Tyrion Lannister : Mmm.

Podrick : High in the halls of the kings who are gone, Jenny would dance with her ghosts, the ones she had lost and the ones she had found and the ones who had loved her the most.

Podrick : The ones who'd been gone for so very long.

Podrick : She couldn't remember their names. They spun her around on the damp old stones.

Podrick : Spun away all her sorrow and pain. And she never wanted to leave

Podrick : Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.

Podrick : Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.

Daenerys Targaryen : Who's that?

Jon Snow : Lyanna Stark.

Daenerys Targaryen : My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her.

Jon Snow : He didn't. He loved her.

Jon Snow : They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard.

Jon Snow : My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.

Daenerys Targaryen : That's impossible.

Jon Snow : I wish it were.

Daenerys Targaryen : Who told you this?

Jon Snow : Bran. He saw it.

Daenerys Targaryen : He saw it?

Jon Snow : And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.

Daenerys Targaryen : A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?

Jon Snow : It's true, Dany. I know it is.

Daenerys Targaryen : If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.

Man : Form up! Get yourselves back!

Northman : Oi!

Northman : Mind out.

Northman : MOVE!

Northman : Look, on the west wall!

Soldier : Get down to the crypt!

Soldier : Just hold.

Man : We'll take him.

Lyanna : Come on, help the lads!

Soldier : Yes, my lady.

Lyanna : Quickly, now! Quickly! Get those in position.

Soldier : Come on.

Soldier : Close the gate!

Soldier : That's it.

Edd : Oh, for fuck's sake. You took your time.

Melisandre : Do you speak their tongue?

Melisandre : Tell them to lift their swords.

Melisandre : Valar morghulis.

Grey Worm : Valar dohaeris.

Davos : Open the gate!

Soldier : Open the gate!

Man : Come. Come on. Easy.

Melisandre : There's no need to execute me, Ser Davos. I'll be dead before the dawn.

Soldier : Cease fire!

Jon Snow : The Night King is coming.

Daenerys Targaryen : The dead are already here.

Brienne : Stand your ground!

Arya Stark : Get down to the crypt.

Sansa Stark : I'm not abandoning my people.

Arya Stark : Take this and go.

Sansa Stark : I don't know how to use it.

Arya Stark : Stick them with the pointy end.

Sam Tarly : Edd! Edd!

Edd : Sam, get up!

Edd : Oh, God. Sam.

Woman : Edd!

Tormund : Fall back! Fall back!

Brienne : Fall back!

Soldier : Come on!

Lyanna : Open the gate!

Soldier : Let us in!

Soldier : Keep moving!

Lyanna : Keep moving, fast!

Soldier : To your posts!

Soldier : Go!

Soldier : Come on, run! Keep moving!

Grey Worm : Protect the retreat!

Grey Worm : Stand your ground!

Jon Snow : Dany!

Soldier : Grab your weapon now!

Soldier : Guard the barricades!

Soldier : Through that pass!

Brienne : Hey! Hey! Hey!

Soldier : Close up the gaps!

Brienne : Go! Hey! Go! Go!

Jaime Lannister : Get in! Get in! Get in! Come on!

Soldier : Move!

Soldier : Retreat!

Lyanna : Protect the gate!

Soldier : Protect the gate!

Jaime Lannister : They're coming! Come on!

Sandor Clegane : Fall back!

Grey Worm : Light the trench! Light the trench!

Soldier : Wait!

Soldier : Light the trench!

Davos : She can't see us.

Davos : Light the trenches!

Soldier : With a torch, light the trenches! Right there.

Soldier : Torch it!

Melisandre : Lord of Light, cast your light upon us. Lord of Light, defend us. For the night is dark and full of terrors!

Melisandre : Lord of Light, cast your light upon us! Lord of Light, defend us! For the night is dark and full of terrors!

Beric : Clegane.

Woman : You must try not to worry yourself.

Varys : At least we're already in a crypt.

Tyrion Lannister : If we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing. Something that makes a difference.

Tyrion Lannister : What? Remember the Battle of Blackwater? I brought us through the Mud Gate.

Varys : And got your face cut in half.

Tyrion Lannister : And it made a difference. If I was out there right now...

Sansa Stark : You'd die. There's nothing you can do.

Tyrion Lannister : You might be surprised at the lengths I'd go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead. I could think of no organization less suited to my talents.

Sansa Stark : Witty remarks won't make a difference. That's why we're down here, none of us can do anything. It's the truth. It's the most heroic thing we can do now look the truth in the face.

Tyrion Lannister : Maybe we should have stayed married.

Sansa Stark : You were the best of them.

Tyrion Lannister : What a terrifying thought.

Sansa Stark : It wouldn't work between us.

Tyrion Lannister : Why not?

Sansa Stark : The Dragon Queen. Your divided loyalties would become a problem.

Missandei : Yes. Without the Dragon Queen, there'd be no problem at all. We'd all be dead already.

Theon Greyjoy : They lit the trench. Bran I just want you to know... I wish... The things I did

Bran Stark : Everything you did brought you where you are now. Where you belong. Home.

Bran Stark : I'm going to go now.

Theon Greyjoy : Go where?

Davos : Man the walls!

Soldier : Man the walls!

Soldier : Man the wall!

Lyanna : Man the walls! Come on!

Lyanna : Get out there! Get moving!

Jaime Lannister : Come on. Come on! Come on! Go, go, go!

Brienne : Come on!

Soldier : They're against the wall!

Soldier : Get more men up here!

Soldier : Fill the gaps, quickly!

Jaime Lannister : Get in there!

Soldier : They're climbing the walls!

Jaime Lannister : Relieve the archers!

Soldier : Relieve the archers!

Jaime Lannister : Archers on top!

Soldier : Move up!

Soldier : Go, go! Come here! Come on!

Soldier : Move back!

Soldier : Stand away!

Soldier : Go on, go on.

Jorah Mormont : Go! Go.

Soldier : Step back.

Soldier : All the way, archers!

Soldier : Hold the wall!

Soldier : The wall, they're coming up!

Jaime Lannister : Draw!

Jaime Lannister : Come on!

Soldier : They're coming up!

Jaime Lannister : Look out!

Beric : Clegane! Clegane!

Beric : Clegane! Clegane, we need you!

Beric : You can't give up on us.

Sandor Clegane : Fuck off! We can't beat them. Don't you see that, you stupid whore? We're fighting Death! They can't beat Death.

Beric : Tell her that.

Soldier : Open the door!

Soldier : Open the door! Open the door! Please! Open it!

Sandor Clegane : Come on!

Beric : Go!

Beric : Run!

Sandor Clegane : We've gotta go!

Melisandre : The Lord brought him back for a purpose. Now that purpose has been served.

Arya Stark : I know you.

Melisandre : And I know you.

Arya Stark : You said we'd meet again.

Melisandre : And here we are. At the end of the world.

Arya Stark : You said I'd shut many eyes forever. You were right about that too.

Melisandre : Brown eyes... green eyes... and blue eyes.

Melisandre : What do we say to the God of Death?

Arya Stark : Not today.

Theon Greyjoy : Here they come!

Theon Greyjoy : Steady, lads.

Theon Greyjoy : Steady now. Make every shot count.

Man : Over there!

Man : There!

Jon Snow : Get off!

Daenerys Targaryen : Dracarys.

Tyrion Lannister : Come on! Come on! No! No, no, no!

Jon Snow : Bran!

Daenerys Targaryen : Go!

Daenerys Targaryen : Jorah!

Bran Stark : Theon.

Bran Stark : You're a good man.

Bran Stark : Thank you.

Jorah Mormont : I'm hurt.

Jon Snow : We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.

Man : To your health.

Gendry Baratheon : Have you seen Arya?

Sandor Clegane : You can still smell the burning bodies, and that's where your head is at.

Gendry Baratheon : I just want to thank her for-

Sandor Clegane : I'm sure you do.

Gendry Baratheon : Look, it's not about that.

Sandor Clegane : Of course it's about that, you twat. Why shouldn't it be? The dead are dead. You're not.

Daenerys Targaryen : Gendry.

Daenerys Targaryen : That's right, isn't it?

Gendry Baratheon : Yes, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : You're Robert Baratheon's son.

Daenerys Targaryen : You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?

Gendry Baratheon : I didn't even know he was my father until after he was dead.

Daenerys Targaryen : Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?

Gendry Baratheon : I don't know, Your Grace.

Daenerys Targaryen : Does anyone?

Daenerys Targaryen : I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.

Gendry Baratheon : I can't be. I'm a bastard.

Daenerys Targaryen : No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you.

Davos : To Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.

All : To Gendry!

Man : Lord Gendry!

Man : Gendry!

Man : That's easy, isn't it?

Tyrion Lannister : A fitting reward for a hero.

Sam : Uh, hold on.

Tyrion Lannister : And a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you.

Man : Come, my lord.

Daenerys Targaryen : See? You're not the only one who's clever.

Woman : I have to go down and get another barrel.

Jaime Lannister : We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?

Davos : The last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm sure you had your reasons.

Davos : I did. I do.

Tyrion Lannister : So did you?

Davos : Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?

Tyrion Lannister : I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.

Davos : And what if I'm not trying to be happy?

Tyrion Lannister : Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with.

Davos : Thank you. I feel much better.

Man : More ale!

Tyrion Lannister : This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.

Bran Stark : It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago. I liked that one.

Tyrion Lannister : You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.

Bran Stark : I'm not Lord of Winterfell.

Tyrion Lannister : You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.

Tyrion Lannister : You don't want it.

Bran Stark : I don't really want anymore.

Tyrion Lannister : I envy you.

Bran Stark : You shouldn't envy me. Mostly I live in the past.

Varys : Come in.

Varys : And?

Varys : Nothing?

Martha : She won't eat.

Varys : We'll try again at supper.

Martha : I think they're watching me.

Varys : Who?

Martha : Her soldiers.

Varys : Of course they are. That's their job.

Varys : What have I told you, Martha?

Martha : The greater the risk, the greater the reward.

Varys : Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.

Varys : The Northern armies?

Jon Snow : Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?

Varys : She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food.

Jon Snow : She shouldn't be alone.

Varys : You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.

Jon Snow : Aren't you worried for her?

Varys : I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath.

Jon Snow : We're not much for riddles where I'm from.

Varys : We both know what she's about to do.

Jon Snow : That's her decision to make. She is our queen.

Varys : Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it.

Jon Snow : What do you want?

Varys : All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.

Jon Snow : I don't want it. I never have.

Varys : I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true

Jon Snow : She is my queen.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace?

Tyrion Lannister : There's something you need to know.

Daenerys Targaryen : Someone has betrayed me.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes.

Daenerys Targaryen : Jon Snow.

Tyrion Lannister : Varys.

Daenerys Targaryen : He knows the truth about Jon.

Tyrion Lannister : He does.

Daenerys Targaryen : Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.

Daenerys Targaryen : And Varys?

Tyrion Lannister : Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.

Daenerys Targaryen : You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.

Tyrion Lannister : It was a mistake.

Daenerys Targaryen : Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?

Tyrion Lannister : She trusts me.

Daenerys Targaryen : Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down.

Tyrion Lannister : If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone.

Tyrion Lannister : But it doesn't matter now.

Daenerys Targaryen : No. It doesn't matter now.

Tyrion Lannister : It was me.

Varys : I hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend.

Daenerys Targaryen : Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ...

Daenerys Targaryen : sentence you to die. Dracarys.

Daenerys Targaryen : This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.

Daenerys Targaryen : It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him.

Daenerys Targaryen : What did I say would happen if you told your sister?

Jon Snow : I don't want it, and that's what I told him.

Daenerys Targaryen : She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.

Jon Snow : I love you. And you will always be my queen.

Daenerys Targaryen : Is that all I am to you? Your queen?

Daenerys Targaryen : All right, then.

Daenerys Targaryen : Let it be fear.

Tyrion Lannister : The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen.

Daenerys Targaryen : In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived.

Tyrion Lannister : They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.

Daenerys Targaryen : They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?

Tyrion Lannister : What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.

Daenerys Targaryen : Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.

Tyrion Lannister : I beg you, my queen-

Daenerys Targaryen : But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.

Daenerys Targaryen : Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies.

Tyrion Lannister : Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.

Daenerys Targaryen : Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.

Daenerys Targaryen : Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.

Daenerys Targaryen : It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.

Guard : Let them pass.

Guard : Through the gate.

Guard : Get going.

Davos : The rearguard should be here by daybreak.

Tyrion Lannister : She wants to attack now.

Jon Snow : Daybreak at the earliest.

Soldier : Careful with that.

Soldier : My lord.

Tyrion Lannister : Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?

Davos : I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?

Soldier : He's always better when he's got some food in him.

Soldier : Problem is when he's got drink in him. See what he did the other week?

Soldier : Aye. Fighting as well. Commander nearly caught him.

Soldier : Ay up. Where you going?

Arya Stark : I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.

Sandor Clegane : Think about it. She kills Cersei, the war's over. There won't be a siege. You might not even die tomorrow.

Soldier : I need to go talk to my captain.

Sandor Clegane : Go ahead, talk to him.

Soldier : Where's he going?

Tyrion Lannister : I drink to eat the skull keeper.

Tyrion Lannister : I want to eat the skull keeper.

Tyrion Lannister : I want to see the ...

Unsullied : We speak the common tongue.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.

Unsullied : We have orders to guard the prisoner.

Tyrion Lannister : Ordered by whom? The queen herself?

Unsullied : No.

Tyrion Lannister : Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot.

Tyrion Lannister : How did they find you?

Tyrion Lannister : Did you consider taking it off?

Jaime Lannister : Cersei once called me "the stupidest Lannister."

Tyrion Lannister : And you're going back to her, to die with her.

Jaime Lannister : You've underestimated her before.

Tyrion Lannister : She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.

Jaime Lannister : Difficult to do from here.

Jaime Lannister : When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?

Tyrion Lannister : Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise.

Jaime Lannister : To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise.

Tyrion Lannister : You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.

Jaime Lannister : The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win.

Tyrion Lannister : She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be.

Jaime Lannister : Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.

Tyrion Lannister : The city will fall tomorrow.

Jaime Lannister : She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-

Tyrion Lannister : I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.

Jaime Lannister : Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before.

Tyrion Lannister : Why?

Tyrion Lannister : Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life.

Jaime Lannister : Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-

Tyrion Lannister : There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again.

Tyrion Lannister : Swear to me.

Jaime Lannister : You have my word.

Tyrion Lannister : If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.

Jaime Lannister : I'll try.

Tyrion Lannister : I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.

Jaime Lannister : Your queen will execute you for this.

Tyrion Lannister : If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible.

Tyrion Lannister : Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never wouldo ve survived my childhood.

Jaime Lannister : You would have.

Tyrion Lannister : You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.

Soldier : Eyes on the horizon!

Soldier : Load the scorpion!

Soldier : Archers, close up!

Man : Come on!

Soldier : Up to the espringal!

Soldier : To the back of it!

Soldier : Archers, line up!

Woman : This way! Come on!

Soldier : Clear the streets now!

Woman : No!

Man : In, now. And you, come on.

Soldier : Inside, now!

Man : Quickly.

Soldier : Yes. Follow down there. They're here. Get to the Red Keep.

Father : My son!

Soldier : Get inside!

Man : Just ahead of you, I can see it!

Soldier : All right, move it!

Woman : Come on!

Soldier : Keep moving!

Soldier : Keep going!

Soldier : Quickly!

Soldier : All the way!

Father : Hold your mother's hand!

Soldier : Make way for the Golden Company!

Soldier : Close the gate!

Tyrion Lannister : If you hear the bells ring, they've surrendered. Call off your men.

Soldier : Move along now, lads.

Soldier : That's it.

Soldier : Go on, move it.

Soldier : Come on, move, move. Faster, faster. Come on, move it. Keep going.

Soldier : Keep moving.

Sandor Clegane : Move.

Soldier : Stay with him.

Man : Hold on.

Woman : Hold my hand.

Nora : Get behind there.

Soldier : Close the gate! No more through!

Nora : No!

Vicky : No! Mommy!

Nora : Vicky! Please!

Vicky : No, please, sir!

Man : Open the gate!

Man : Open it!

Soldier : Get back!

Nora : Look, try that one! Go! Go!

Soldier : The gates are locked now!

Woman : Open!

Woman : Open the gate! Soldier! Soldier!

Man : Please open the gate!

Soldier : Go back to your homes!

Soldier : Stay back! It's closed!

Jaime Lannister : Soldier!

Soldier : Move away! Stop!

Man : Let us in!

Man : We're not leaving!

Soldier : Turn!

Euron Greyjoy : Turn it around! Turn it around!

Euron Greyjoy : Get back! Back!

Euron Greyjoy : Fire!

Soldier : I can see her! Ready!

Soldier : Move!

Soldier : Fire!

Soldier : Reload!

Soldier : Faster! Hurry!

Man : Go!

Man : Run!

Qyburn : Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : All we need is one good shot.

Qyburn : The scorpions have all been destroyed, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : The Iron Fleet hold Blackwater Bay. Euron killed one of her dragons. He can kill another.

Qyburn : Your Grace, the Iron Fleet is burning. The gates have been breached. The Golden Company-

Cersei Lannister : Our men will fight harder than sellswords ever could. They will defend their queen to the last man.

Qyburn : Yes, Your Grace.

Cersei Lannister : The Red Keep has never fallen. It won't fall today.

Man : No, no, no!

Jon Snow : Move, move!

Man : Run. Run! Come on!

Soldier : Ring the bells!

Man : The bells!

Man : Ring the bells!

Woman : Ring the bells!

Man : Ring the bloody bells!

Woman : Tell the queen to ring the bells.

Man : Ring the bells! Ring the bell!

Woman : This way.

Soldier : Ring the bell!

Man : Ring the bell!

Man : Ring them!

Man : Help us!

Man : In the name of the-

Man : Queen! We're surrounded!

Man : Now! Come on!

Man : Hurry up!

Jon Snow : No! Get back! Get back!

Jon Snow : Stay! Stay!

Davos : Quickly. Quickly.

Jon Snow : Stop!

Soldier : Get off me! Get off, bitch!

Woman : No, get off! Help! Help! No!

Lannister Soldier : Go! Go!

Jon Snow : Find somewhere to hide.

Man : My God!

Euron Greyjoy : The Kingslayer.

Jaime Lannister : We need to get the queen out of King's Landing.

Euron Greyjoy : Listen. That's the sound of a city dying. It's over.

Jaime Lannister : Well, maybe for you.

Euron Greyjoy : If you kill another king before you die they'll sing about you forever.

Jaime Lannister : You're no king.

Euron Greyjoy : Oh, but I am. And I fucked the queen. If I win, I'll bring your head to Cersei so you can kiss her one last time.

Qyburn : Your Grace, it isn't safe here any longer.

Cersei Lannister : The Red Keep is the safest place in the city.

Qyburn : The Unsullied have breached the gates of the Red Keep.

Qyburn : Maegor's Holdfast would be a better place to wait out the storm.

Euron Greyjoy : You fought well for a cripple.

Euron Greyjoy : Another king for you.

Euron Greyjoy : But I got you!

Euron Greyjoy : I got you!

Euron Greyjoy : I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister.

Sandor Clegane : Go home, girl. The fire will get her, or one of the Dothraki.

Sandor Clegane : Or maybe that dragon will eat her. It doesn't matter. She's dead. And you'll be dead too if you don't get out of here.

Arya Stark : I'm going to kill her.

Sandor Clegane : You think you wanted revenge a long time? I've been after it all my life.

Sandor Clegane : It's all I care about. And look at me.

Sandor Clegane : Look at me! You wanna be like me?

Sandor Clegane : You come with me, you die here.

Arya Stark : Sandor.

Arya Stark : Thank you.

Sandor Clegane : Your Grace.

Sandor Clegane : Hello, big brother.

Cersei Lannister : Ser Gregor, stay by my side.

Cersei Lannister : Ser Gregor, I command you.

Qyburn : Obey your queen, Ser Gregor.

Sandor Clegane : Yeah, that's you. That's what you've always been.

Cersei Lannister : You're hurt.

Jaime Lannister : It doesn't matter.

Cersei Lannister : You're bleeding.

Owen : Alanna! Alanna! Have you seen my wife? Have you seen my wife?

Arya Stark : Let go.

Owen : Have you seen my wife?

Man : Out of the way!

Man : No!

Sandor Clegane : Oh.

Nora : Take my hand. Take my hand! Get up. Get up.

Nora : No. No.

Arya Stark : Wait! Wait! No!

Sandor Clegane : Fucking die!

Jon Snow : We need to fall back! Fall back behind the wall! Fall back!

Soldier : Fall back!

Jon Snow : Get out of the city! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back!

Arya Stark : You can't stay here. You have to keep moving.

Woman : We can't go out there.

Arya Stark : You have to.

Woman : Everyone out there is dead.

Arya Stark : If you stay here, you'll die. Follow me.

Arya Stark : Follow me!

Man : Come on, quickly. All of you.

Vicky : Mama! Mama! Mama!

Vicky : No. Mama! Mama! Mama!

Arya Stark : Get up. Get up!

Arya Stark : We have to keep moving.

Nora : Take her. Take her!

Nora : Take her.

Arya Stark : Come on! Come on!

Jaime Lannister : This way.

Cersei Lannister : I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live.

Cersei Lannister : Don't let me die, Jaime. Please don't let me die.

Jaime Lannister : It's all right.

Cersei Lannister : Please don't let me die.

Cersei Lannister : I don't want to die.

Jaime Lannister : Just look- Look at me. Look at me.

Cersei Lannister : Not like this. Not like this. Not like this.

Jaime Lannister : Look- Look- Look me in the eye. Don't look away. Don't look- Look at me! Just look at me.

Jaime Lannister : Nothing else matters. Nothing else matters. Only us.

Tyrion Lannister : I'll find you later.

Jon Snow : It's not safe. Let me send some men with you.

Tyrion Lannister : I'm going alone.

Grey Worm : In the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen, I sentence you to die.

Jon Snow : Grey Worm!

Jon Snow : It's over.

Grey Worm : These men are prisoners. It is not over until the queen's enemies are defeated.

Davos : How much more defeated do you want them to be? They're on their knees.

Grey Worm : They are breathing.

Davos : Look around you, friend. We won.

Grey Worm : I obey my queen's commands, not yours.

Jon Snow : And what are the queen's commands?

Grey Worm : Kill all who follow Cersei Lannister." These are free men. They chose to fight for her.

Davos : Easy, men. Easy! Easy.

Davos : Jon. We should speak with the queen.

Daenerys Targaryen : Blood of my blood.

Daenerys Targaryen : You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.

Daenerys Targaryen : Your tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms.

Daenerys Targaryen : Torgo Nudho.

Daenerys Targaryen : You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War.

Daenerys Targaryen : Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant!

Daenerys Targaryen : But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!

Daenerys Targaryen : From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel.

Daenerys Targaryen : Will you break the wheel with me?

Daenerys Targaryen : You freed your brother. You committed treason.

Tyrion Lannister : I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.

Daenerys Targaryen : Take him.

Jon Snow : What are you doing here?

Jon Snow : Hey, what happened?

Arya Stark : I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.

Jon Snow : She's everyone's queen now.

Arya Stark : Try telling Sansa.

Jon Snow : Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.

Arya Stark : Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.

Tyrion Lannister : Did you bring any wine?

Jon Snow : No.

Tyrion Lannister : Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, "See, I told you." It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going.

Tyrion Lannister : So is there life after death?

Jon Snow : Not that I've seen.

Tyrion Lannister : I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.

Jon Snow : You didn't.

Tyrion Lannister : I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not.

Jon Snow : I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.

Tyrion Lannister : Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?

Tyrion Lannister : She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.

Jon Snow : And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today.

Tyrion Lannister : Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.

Jon Snow : You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister.

Tyrion Lannister : My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.

Jon Snow : Cersei left her no choice.

Tyrion Lannister : The moment the gates fell, the battle was over.

Jon Snow : She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.

Tyrion Lannister : And she burned down a city for it.

Jon Snow : Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield.

Tyrion Lannister : Would you have done it?

Jon Snow : What?

Tyrion Lannister : You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?

Jon Snow : I don't know.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know.

Jon Snow : What's it matter what I'd do?

Tyrion Lannister : It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men.

Tyrion Lannister : When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?

Tyrion Lannister : I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.

Jon Snow : Love is the death of duty.

Tyrion Lannister : You just came up with that?

Jon Snow : Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.

Tyrion Lannister : Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?

Tyrion Lannister : It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?

Jon Snow : That's her decision. She is the queen.

Jon Snow : I'm sorry it came to this.

Tyrion Lannister : And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?

Jon Snow : My sisters will be loyal to the throne.

Tyrion Lannister : Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.

Jon Snow : She doesn't get to choose.

Tyrion Lannister : No. But you do. And you have to choose now.

Daenerys Targaryen : When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.

Jon Snow : I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.

Daenerys Targaryen : It was necessary.

Jon Snow : Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!

Daenerys Targaryen : I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.

Jon Snow : And Tyrion?

Daenerys Targaryen : He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?

Jon Snow : Forgive him.

Daenerys Targaryen : I can't.

Jon Snow : You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand.

Jon Snow : Please, Dany.

Daenerys Targaryen : We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.

Jon Snow : The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.

Daenerys Targaryen : And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.

Jon Snow : How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?

Daenerys Targaryen : Because I know what is good. And so do you.

Jon Snow : I don't.

Daenerys Targaryen : You do. You do. You've always known.

Jon Snow : What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.

Daenerys Targaryen : They don't get to choose.

Daenerys Targaryen : Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastardo s name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together.

Jon Snow : You are my queen. Now, and always.

Sansa Stark : Where's Jon?

Grey Worm : He is our prisoner.

Sansa Stark : So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.

Grey Worm : We will decide what we do with our prisoners. This is our city now.

Sansa Stark : If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest.

Grey Worm : And you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.

Yara Greyjoy : Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.

Sansa Stark : You swore to follow a tyrant.

Yara Greyjoy : She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves.

Arya Stark : Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.

Davos : Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?

Davos : If it weren't for you and your men, we wouldo ve lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way.

Grey Worm : We do not need payment. We need justice. Jon Snow cannot go free.

Tyrion Lannister : It's not for you to decide.

Grey Worm : You are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you.

Tyrion Lannister : You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.

Maester Wolkan : We don't have a king or queen.

Tyrion Lannister : You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.

Grey Worm : Make your choice, then.

Edmure : My lords and ladies. I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives. What we decide today will reverberate through the annals of history. I stand before you as one of the senior lords in the country. A veteran of two wars. And I like to think my experience has led to some small skill in statecraft - and underst-

Sansa Stark : Uncle? Please sit.

Maester Wolkan : Well, we have to choose someone.

Sam : Why just us?

Sam : Um- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone.

Edmure : Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.

Yohn Royce : I'll ask my horse.

Edmure : I suppose you want the crown.

Tyrion Lannister : Me? The Imp?

Tyrion Lannister : Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her.

Tyrion Lannister : Can't think of a worse choice.

Davos : Who, then?

Tyrion Lannister : I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.

Tyrion Lannister : What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?

Sansa Stark : Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.

Tyrion Lannister : Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break.

Tyrion Lannister : From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm.

Tyrion Lannister : I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?

Bran Stark : Why do you think I came all this way?

Tyrion Lannister : To Brandon of House Stark... I say aye.

Sam : Aye.

Edmure : Aye.

Riverlands Lord : Aye.

Yohn Royce : Aye.

Maester Wolkan : Aye.

Robin : Aye.

Dornish Prince : Aye.

Yara Greyjoy : Aye.

Ironborn Lord : Aye.

Vale Lord : Aye.

Gendry Baratheon : Aye.

Davos : I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.

Brienne : Aye.

Sansa Stark : I love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros. And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again. The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years.

Tyrion Lannister : All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.

All : All hail Bran the Broken!

Bran Stark : Lord Tyrion, you will be my Hand.

Tyrion Lannister : N- No, Your Grace, I don't want it.

Bran Stark : And I don't want to be king.

Tyrion Lannister : I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else.

Bran Stark : I choose you.

Grey Worm : You cannot.

Bran Stark : Yes, I can. I'm king.

Grey Worm : This man is a criminal. He deserves justice.

Bran Stark : He just got it. He's made many terrible mistakes. He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.

Grey Worm : It is not enough.

Tyrion Lannister : Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.

Jon Snow : There's still a Night's Watch?

Tyrion Lannister : The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.

Tyrion Lannister : You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose.

Jon Snow : Was it right? What I did?

Tyrion Lannister : What we did.

Jon Snow : It doesn't feel right.

Tyrion Lannister : Ask me again in ten years.

Jon Snow : I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.

Tyrion Lannister : I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.

Unsullied Captain : All the men have boarded.

Grey Worm : Good. We sail for the isle of Naath.

Sansa Stark : I wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?

Jon Snow : The North is free, thanks to you.

Sansa Stark : But they lost their king.

Jon Snow : Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for.

Jon Snow : You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black.

Arya Stark : I can't.

Jon Snow : You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?

Arya Stark : I'm not going back north.

Sansa Stark : Where are you going?

Arya Stark : What's west of Westeros?

Arya Stark : No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.

Jon Snow : You have your Needle?

Arya Stark : Right here.

Jon Snow : Your Grace.

Jon Snow : I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.

Bran Stark : You were exactly where you were supposed to be.

Tyrion Lannister : That's not- Uh-

Tyrion Lannister : What's this?

Sam : A Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.

Tyrion Lannister : I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.

Sam : Oh, I wouldn't say that.

Tyrion Lannister : Oh, he's kind to me. Never wouldo ve guessed.

Tyrion Lannister : He's not kind?

Sam : He-

Tyrion Lannister : He what? What does he say about me?

Sam : I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem.

Tyrion Lannister : Your Grace.

Davos : Your Grace.

Bronn : Your Grace.

Sam : Your Grace.

Bran Stark : We appear to be missing a Master of Whisperers. And a Master of Laws. And a Master of War.

Tyrion Lannister : Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks.

Bran Stark : And Drogon? Any word?

Sam : He was last spotted flying east, toward-

Bronn : The farther away, the better.

Bran Stark : Perhaps I can find him. Do carry on with the rest.

Tyrion Lannister : As you wish, Your Grace.

Brienne : Ser Podrick.

Tyrion Lannister : We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign.

Sam : Long may he reign.

Davos : Long may he reign.

Brienne : Long may he reign.

Bronn : Long may he reign.

Tyrion Lannister : That will improve.

Bran Stark : I'm sure it will.

Tyrion Lannister : Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?

Bronn : In full, my lord Hand.

Tyrion Lannister : Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?

Bronn : Indeed we can.

Tyrion Lannister : Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair.

Davos : We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.

Bronn : The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin.

Davos : Any more.

Bronn : You Master of Grammar now too?

Tyrion Lannister : Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population.

Sam : The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out-

Bronn : The strong live and the weak don't.

Tyrion Lannister : Find the best builders and set them to the task.

Bronn : Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction.

Sam : Uh... the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.

Bronn : Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly.

Brienne : I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.

Bronn : I think that's a very presumptuous statement.

Tyrion Lannister : I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.

Man : The Queen in the North!

All : The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North! The Queen in the North!
